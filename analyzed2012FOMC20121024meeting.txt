Passage number 1.
 MR. WILLIAMS.  We decided to delegate that to the first vice presidents.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Williams is simply stating a decision that was made.


Passage number 2.
  [Laughter] MR. EVANS. They’re better at it than we are. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Very good.  Congratulations, and we’re trying to recover here in Washington. Okay.  The first item on our agenda is “Thresholds.”  This has to do with our forward guidance for the federal funds rate.  As you know, we currently have guidance that suggests the date at which we expect to begin to raise rates.  I think many people around the table agree that that’s not the optimal way to communicate our future policy, and that it would be better if we could do a state-contingent type of policy. But the details matter—in particular, the language we use, the choice of indicators, the values, and so on.  So we have asked the staff to prepare a  background memo, which, I hope you agree, was very good, very informative.  I will ask Eric Engen to make a presentation, we’ll ask some questions, and then we’ll do a go-round and see what the views are on this issue.  So let me turn it over to Eric.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 3.
 MR. BULLARD.  Yes.  Thanks for the presentation.  I’m looking at the “Federal Funds Rate” picture on exhibit 1.  The green here, the outcome-based rule, has the liftoff date in thesecond quarter of 2016, if I’m reading this correctly.  I think the relevant comparison would be this particular threshold versus the Committee just saying that instead of mid-2015, the date is going to be the second quarter of 2016.  Then would I get the same green lines here that you’re showing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Bullard is simply seeking clarification and expressing his understanding of the information presented.


Passage number 4.
 MR. ENGEN.  In the model, whether it’s an announced date or whether it’s the thresholds, the public takes that as credible and they are following the same rules.  So if you just shifted the date, you would get very similar results.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 5.
 MR. BULLARD. We often talk about thresholds as if the state-contingent policy is going to give us something different than the date-contingent policy, but really, in the model, it’s the same thing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not suggest any form of contention or disagreement. It is simply explaining that in the model being discussed, thresholds and state-contingent policies are essentially the same thing.


Passage number 6.
 MR. ENGEN.  Well, would those thresholds help clarify that. In the model here, we’re assuming that the public has the same outlook for economic conditions and fully understands what the intent of policy is.  Providing the conditions that we expect to see at the time of liftoff may help clarify for the public exactly what those conditions are.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is suggesting that providing certain conditions may help clarify the intentions of a policy to the public.


Passage number 7.
 MR. WILCOX.  Correct me if I’m wrong, but the date-contingent policy and the thresholds will give exactly the same answer in a nonstochastic environment, correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement seeking clarification, indicating that the speaker wants to make sure their understanding is correct.


Passage number 8.
 MR. ENGEN.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: The word "yes" indicates that there is contention or disagreement in the passage. However, without the actual passage being provided, it is not possible to determine the specific nature of the disagreement.


Passage number 9.
 MR. WILCOX.  But if the date-contingent statement is a binding commitment, they’ll give different results in a stochastic simulation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is discussing different results in a stochastic simulation, but there is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 10.
 MR. BULLARD.  Well, in a stochastic simulation, the date, for instance, might move earlier because the data come in more positively, but a date-contingent policy would not move.  And according to the model, that would actually be more accommodative than the state-contingent policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating how a stochastic simulation and a date-contingent policy might differ in their response to new data.


Passage number 11.
   MR ENGEN.  If you had the dates always moving exactly where the thresholds were and the public understood that, then yes, they would behave the same in the deterministic or the stochastic environment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating a hypothetical scenario and its implication, without any conflicting viewpoints being presented.


Passage number 12.
 MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

This passage does not include any statements or indications of disagreement or contention. It simply includes a statement of gratitude ("Thank you") and a request for further questions. There is no conflicting viewpoint or argument presented.


Passage number 13.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Just a technical question.  On the simulations as you do them, the assumption appears to be that once these thresholds are in fact triggered, policy would then revert to the outcome-based rule or something upon the reaching of the threshold.  So the presumption is that the Committee will in fact act when those thresholds are reached.  Is that correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply a technical question about the assumptions made in simulations.


Passage number 14.
 MR. ENGEN.  Well, I just want to clarify. It is definitely the case that once one of the thresholds is crossed—or if both of them are crossed simultaneously—policy moves to, say, the outcome-based rule.  That doesn’t necessarily mean that the federal funds rate starts to rise.  And indeed, in some of the simulations that we did, particularly in the stochastic setting, you can see that there’s a much wider range across all of the different policy settings for crossings than there is for actually having the federal funds rate start to rise.  So it’s not the case that, immediately after crossing a threshold, it is assumed that the federal funds rate has to start rising.  If the prescription of the rule is such that it would say, “Still keep the funds rate at approximately zero,” it would stay there until the prescription of the rule had it starting to rise.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply explaining the process and outcomes of crossing certain thresholds in a policy.


Passage number 15.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. "MR. PLOSSER" can be seen as the name of a person or a title, but it does not imply any conflict or disagreement.


Passage number 16.
 MR. ENGEN.  So it’s not a trigger in the sense of the funds rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a statement of fact made by Mr. Engen and does not express any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 17.
 MR. PLOSSER.  No, I understand.  But you are switching regimes at that point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Plosser is simply stating that he understands that there will be a switch in regimes at a certain point.


Passage number 18.
 MR. ENGEN.  It switches from the threshold to a policy rule, yes.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Seeing no more questions, let’s start with Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply confirming an observation made by someone and then moving on to the next part of the discussion.


Passage number 19.
  MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thanks.  I had a question for President Lacker, because I think this issue about labor force participation has come up before when we talked about thresholds.  So I’d be interested in what conditions about labor force participation would lead you to want to raise rates even though the unemployment rate was, say, above 6½ percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a question directed at President Lacker, and there is no clear expression of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 20.
 MR. LACKER.  I’m sorry—above what.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: This passage does not contain any statements that indicate contention or disagreement. It appears to be a simple interruption or clarification.


Passage number 21.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Above 6½.  Suppose the threshold was 6½, as Governor Tarullo talked about.  You’re positing that labor force participation is growing rapidly.  What would be the conditions that would lead us to want to raise rates at that time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It is a straightforward discussion of a hypothetical scenario and the conditions that would warrant a rate increase.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 22.
 MR. LACKER. In the staff memo, figure 2 shows the performance of a threshold strategy in the face of unanticipated shocks to aggregate demand.  There’s stronger demand, weaker demand, and the baseline. Real GDP growth varies substantially. The federal funds rate path varies substantially. In the stronger-demand case, it’s 4 percent in late 2015; in the baseline, it begins to rise in 2015; and in the weaker-demand case, it doesn’t rise until the first quarter of 2017. The civilian unemployment rate is very different across the scenarios. Well, what if labor force participation is far more elastic with regard to employment growth than depicted by these simulations.  If that’s true, the unemployment rate might not vary much at all across these scenarios in the limit—it’s conceivable—in which case we’d have different demand conditions but virtually the same unemployment rate, and we might need a 4 percent funds rate in late 2015, or we might need to wait until 2017—we don’t know.  It could be orthogonal.  It could be very independent of what rate we want. That’s the kind of thing I have in mind, President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes.

Explanation: Mr. Lacker is presenting a different perspective or viewpoint from what is depicted in the staff memo. He suggests that if labor force participation is more elastic, the unemployment rate might not vary much across scenarios. This introduces a possible disagreement or alternative viewpoint.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 23.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Okay.  I guess I still don’t quite understand your objective function.  I’ll have to think about that one.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. This is indicated by the phrase "I guess I still don't quite understand your objective function" which suggests that the speaker (Mr. Kocherlakota) does not agree or have the same understanding as the person they are speaking to.


Passage number 24.
 MR. LACKER.  I’m sorry.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement or apology.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 25.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I still don’t quite understand your objective function.  You’re defining it somehow in terms of GDP or employment in a way.  You’re not defining it in terms of utilization, I guess.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage indicates that there is disagreement or lack of clarity regarding the objective function being discussed. Mr. Kocherlakota states that he does not fully understand how the objective function is defined, particularly in relation to GDP, employment, and utilization.


Passage number 26.
 MR. LACKER. This turns on the question of the relationship between labor force participation and capacity.  And you could identify those very closely.  There’s a lot of literature that talks about the permeability of that boundary. I don’t think the standard models on which a New Keynesian Phillips curve is built say much about that margin at all. They talk about output growth and inflation.  They talk about marginal cost, which is going to depend on employment, not on the supply of labor.  So what we know about the interaction of inflation and output growth, and the possibility for nonneutrality in the standard models these days, links it to marginal cost, and that’s going to be linked to real output and growth.  That suggests that the reaction function should depend on what happens to employment growth, not on what happens to unemployment, at least if unemployment can be influenced independently by variation in labor force participation.  You see. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. On another topic, I would question your statement that this is inconsistent with the consensus statement.  The consensus statement is about long-run monetary neutrality.  It’s not inconsistent to have a Taylor rule, for example, that defines short-run monetary policy as a function of current variables without claiming that you can peg the unemployment rate in the long run.  So I don’t think that’s inconsistent.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing an analysis and offering different perspectives on the relationship between labor force participation and capacity, as well as the interaction of inflation and output growth. They also address a potential misunderstanding regarding the consensus statement.


Passage number 27.
 MR. EVANS. I’m sorry, I’m not sure I followed the interchange here very well, so if I could express it the way that I would think about this.  The concern that I would have thought you were trying to point us toward was, if we find ourselves with a threshold that is inappropriate  so that we find ourselves pushing a ton of accommodation into the economy, then we could get stuck.  Well, the inflation safeguard is there to protect us against that.  So if we’re not generating a lot of inflationary pressures, I’m not quite sure what the risk is that you’re pointing to—as I see you shake your head.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 28.
 MR. LACKER. I take it that we’re trying to design a policy that doesn’t go off track. It doesn’t require us to “go off the rails” and then “get back on the rails.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating that the goal is to design a policy that stays on track without deviating.


Passage number 29.
” MR. EVANS.  Sure.  I thought “off the rails” was inflation in this case.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states their interpretation of the phrase "off the rails."


Passage number 30.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes.  But you don’t want to drive the car down the highway just counting on bouncing off guardrails to keep you on the road.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing agreement with the idea that relying on guardrails to stay on the road is not a wise approach.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 31.
 MR. EVANS.  That’s what it is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage indicates a potential disagreement or contention between Mr. Evans and another party.


Passage number 32.
 MR. STEIN. I think this is the center lane.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not involve contention or disagreement. Mr. Stein is expressing his opinion or belief about the topic being discussed, but there is no opposition or conflict present in the statement.


Passage number 33.
 MR. LACKER.  This is the broader point we’ve talked about before on this topic, about the role of the inflation escape clause. The policy rules we implement and the models we have possess the property that it’s always the case that inflation is expected to return to the monetary policy authority’s target.  Always.  Probability 1.  Very definitely.  These thresholds sound like, “Well, we’re going to run a policy that might not be consistent with that, and then when inflation goes away from that, we’ll change our mind and come back.” And it means you have to wait and see that happen.  Ideally, you want to run a policy that maintains price stability, not one that lets it drift around.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, is expressing his viewpoint and explaining the importance of maintaining price stability in monetary policy.


Passage number 34.
 MR. EVANS.  Right.  But 2½ percent is so close to our long-run target, that’s really not much play at all. The issue is not so much what’s in our models.  In this particular case, it strikes me that the safeguard is about not what’s in our models but what’s in the real world.  I go out and talk to businesspeople all the time; I try to convey these types of accommodative policies, andthey leap to 3 percent, 4 percent inflation before anybody is breathing hard. In that world, we’ve got the safeguard.  So, at any rate—that’s my interpretation. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 35.
 MR. FISHER.  I like those.  I just wanted to underscore my support for them.  But again, I come back to the numbers, which I’m concerned about.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: 
There is no direct contention or disagreement expressed in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Fisher, simply expresses his support for something and then mentions his concern about numbers. There is no opposition or conflicting viewpoints presented.


Passage number 36.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ve been supportive of using numerical economic outcomes to set thresholds rather than continuing to use amounts when discussing asset purchases or dates when discussing the eventual liftoff date. I am well aware that no one variable can proxy for labor market conditions or, for that matter, the underlying rate of inflation. In reality, we look at a broad array of data when evaluating how we are progressing against our dual mandate.  This would be a problem if we were choosing a single variable to trigger action.  However, providing a numerical threshold merely provides guidance on when we will discuss whether the broader array of data is consistent with taking a new action.  Thus, if there are a variety of sometimes conflicting measures of inflation and labor market conditions, that’s not a reason to avoid adopting thresholds. I view numerical thresholds as being useful for two reasons.  First, they provide a simple communication to the public tied to economic outcomes.  We will not take action to reverse ourpolicies until we reach a threshold.  So if there is a negative shock, monetary policy automatically becomes more accommodative as the date for ending asset purchases or reaching liftoff is pushed further in the future.  Second, qualitative measures can be offset by participants’ communications, which, at times, may make our actions less effective.  A quantitative threshold provides a clear indication that there is a consensus among voters that tightening will not begin at least until the threshold is attained.  To be effective, a threshold must be simple to communicate and observable to the public.  Unlike a trigger, it does not need to be precise.  We are committing only to postpone action until the threshold is met and, at that time, to begin a discussion of whether taking action is consistent with the path to achieve our dual mandate within an acceptable time frame. For a proxy of labor market conditions, I would use the unemployment rate.  It is a variable widely understood by the public.  At times, the unemployment rate can fall for reasons other than improvements in labor market conditions, but because we are setting a threshold, not a trigger, I am comfortable with that degree of imprecision. I would use an unemployment rate of 7¼ percent to begin a discussion of whether labor market conditions had improved “substantially,” a term not well defined in qualitative terms for the public or, for that matter, for ourselves.  I would use an unemployment rate of 6½ percent to begin a discussion of a potential liftoff of short-term rates. For inflation, we have a target tied to the PCE inflation rate, so the threshold variable should be the same as our target variable.  If we had a median PCE inflation forecast in the medium term that was publicly available at each meeting, that could be a potential threshold. What we decide about the SEP and consensus forecasts will be discussed later in the meeting. In the absence of a regularly disclosed PCE inflation forecast, I would use the four-quarter moving  average of actual PCE inflation and an inflation threshold of 3 percent.  The four-quarter moving average smooths the series to reflect the supply shocks that have occurred with some regularity, and the 3 percent threshold reflects that even this threshold is crossed in the historical data around times of significant supply shocks. I view the threshold as a commitment to not take action until the threshold is reached.  As a result, in answer to 2.d., I would not tighten before a threshold is crossed. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their support for using numerical economic outcomes as thresholds for action, rather than specific amounts or dates. They explain that using thresholds provides guidance for when to discuss taking action, based on a broader array of data. The speaker also suggests specific numerical thresholds for labor market conditions and inflation. Overall, the passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 37.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Quite a number of my points have been made already, but I will go through some thoughts anyway.  I haven’t been a great fan of date guidance for a number of reasons.  Date guidance is hard to adjust with changing conditions, and although we went to great pains to describe it as conditional, the date is taken as a commitment or promise by much of the public.  In principle, I think expressing forward guidance in the form of economic conditionality ought to be preferable, but on consideration, I’ve concluded that specific numerical thresholds taken alone might not improve the clarity and effectiveness of our communications.  So I’m going to advocate for thresholds that are pretty substantially qualified, even at the risk of diluting their influence on economic conditions. I’m especially skeptical of a single numerical threshold for the unemployment situation.  In my view, the unemployment rate is not a sufficient statistic for describing the economic conditionality we ought to have in mind.  The Chairman put some emphasis on this point in his last press conference.  In response to a question on the new LSAP, the Chairman emphasized that the decision process for continuing, adjusting, or halting the new LSAP program would be based not on a single market metric, but rather an array of indicators that collectively present a full  picture of labor market conditions and prospects, and that the decision would involve a qualitative judgment in the end.  I don’t want to speak for you, Mr. Chairman, but that’s my interpretation of what you said.  I’m not sure I understand why this holistic approach to the conditionality that will guide our asset purchase decisions should not also guide our policy rate decisions.  If the Committee chooses to adopt a numerical threshold for employment, I think it’s likely that the threshold we introduce would have to be accompanied by substantial qualification to the effect that the unemployment rate is just one of several indicators; that, in practice, the Committee will synthesize a view from an evaluation of a dashboard of relevant data; and, therefore, that the single unemployment rate should not be taken as decisive.  I have similar concerns about the risk of conveying simplistic and potentially misleading specificity around a single inflation metric.  However, I don’t feel so strongly on this side of the threshold question because there’s been a lot of public education explaining that we look at a variety of inflation numbers to discern the trend.  So I do not advocate full substitution of single numerical thresholds for the current practice of date guidance. Now, to answer some of the questions:  “Should the thresholds replace the date-based guidance or be combined with the date-based guidance.”  On balance, I favor a combined approach, repeated routinely for a while, at least until conditions are such that we would want to change the date. The public has become accustomed to the date-based guidance.  Keeping the date-based guidance provides more information, even if it may dilute somewhat the primacy of the thresholds and create a little confusion.  Because the date currently projected is far in the future, it might make sense to use this combined approach for some time and then later drop the date guidance when the economy has evolved further.  “What variables should the thresholds reference.  Regarding inflation, should the thresholds reference actual inflation or a projection.” I think this was said by someone earlier, by President Bullard, but I don’t believe it’s a good idea to specify an unemployment threshold in terms of a realized value while expressing an inflation threshold solely in terms of a projection.  Symmetrical treatment is desirable in order to preserve a sense of a balanced approach.  And I think it’s possible to craft language explaining that the threshold both acknowledges realized values and places weight on the outlook for each threshold indicator.  For example, focusing on inflation, the statement might read something like this:  “. . . provided that realized inflation as indicated by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, taken together with the Committee’s projection of inflation at a one-to two-year horizon, does not deviate by more than ½ percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent objective and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.”  I realize that that’s a mouthful, but I think it’s possible to combine both backward looking and forward looking in one statement.  I’m comfortable with an unemployment threshold of 6½ percent and a ½ percent tolerance above the inflation objective, if sufficiently qualified as I said earlier. There is a question of, “In what way, if at all, should the language indicate that the Committee may tighten policy before any thresholds are crossed.” I favor explicitly communicating that conditions may develop in which, in the Committee’s judgment, policy would be tightened before a threshold is crossed.  This may have to be repeated ritualistically to ensure that it isn’t lost on the public consciousness.  I think language to this effect could be easily enough included in the statement.  The final question:  Should, and how should, “the Committee provide guidance about the timing of liftoff after a threshold is crossed and the likely course of policy after the initial increase” in the fed funds rate.  The language that the staff members developed in their memo works quite well in that respect.  So I think it’s quite sufficient. To summarize my views, I believe the tests of an approach to thresholds, if adopted, should be as follows: improves clarity of the Committee’s reaction function to the extent possible, and I think there are limits in how far we can achieve that; allows flexibility to deal with various circumstances; recognizes that multiple indicators must be considered, and the Committee will make a judgment call in the end; and does not convey that thresholds have a hard and fast mechanical character.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a series of statements expressing the speaker's opinions. There is no contention or disagreement.


Passage number 38.
 MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, appreciate the thought and the effort that went into the staff memo on thresholds.  After listening to the discussion this morning, I’m actually not as critical of a calendar date as I used to be, as I’ll comment on. If feasible, I would like to move away from calendar-date descriptions in our forward guidance and move toward descriptions based more on economic conditions, whether qualitative or quantitative.  I see our September statement as actually a small step in that direction, and I think that’s a good step.  But moving further to explicit thresholds for funds rate liftoff obviously would have two main benefits, as has been discussed already.  With suitably aggressive thresholds, we effectively signal our intention to stay low for longer than we typically would.  Maybe that’s a good thing.  But more important, thresholds cause our forward guidance to adjust to incoming data automatically.  If labor markets improve faster than expected or inflation gets too high, the expected timing of liftoff will move forward, and on the flip side, if the economy slows, theexpected liftoff date endogenously moves out.  So there’s no need for the Committee to deliberate about whether or how much to move the calendar date.  That is, to me, the main benefit. I do think, as others have said, that thresholds bring some new challenges and potential pitfalls, and I’m just going to go through a couple of them.  First—and it’s discussed in the memo, and President Bullard talked about this—it’s absolutely critical to communicate that we’re talking about thresholds here and not triggers.  President Rosengren, you made that point but thought the difference would not be confused. I’m actually more worried that this could be confused by the public, because if it’s interpreted as triggers, that would be a negative thing. Second, as we’ve talked about, focusing on just two variables in describing the conditions for liftoff could be problematic.  Obviously, we look at countless variables.  We look at forecasts, along with the risks to the outlook, in setting policy.  I think that having these unemployment rate and inflation rate thresholds implies too tight of a relationship, and I’m just going to talk about unemployment for now, assuming that the inflation escape clause isn’t hit.  It implies a tighter relationship between unemployment and the date of liftoff than I think is really there.  And this problem is illustrated by the notion of the medium-term natural rate of interest, or r*.  Recall that the medium-term natural rate of interest is the intercept in a Taylor rule.  So, according to the Taylor rule, the unemployment rate at which the funds rate rises above zero depends on one’s estimate of the natural rate of interest. If the natural rate of interest declines, then liftoff would occur at a lower unemployment rate than otherwise.  And that’s just another way of saying that the unemployment rate associated with the liftoff date is not invariant to the estimate that you have of the r* natural rate of interest.  This is not just a theoretical point. It’s actually something that I think has been pretty important over the last couple of years.  As I’vementioned and as the Vice Chairman and Governor Yellen have mentioned, there’s quite a bit of evidence that the natural rate of interest has declined significantly over recent years. Indeed, my own thinking is that the appropriate threshold for the unemployment rate has come down significantly, in part because of mounting evidence of a sizable decline in the natural rate of interest. The current Tealbook also illustrates a related point nicely, since it modified the constant term in the outcome-based rule in a way that’s equivalent to lowering r* and the conditions for liftoff. So, despite these concerns about thresholds, we should strive to find ways to communicate more in terms of economic conditions rather than calendar dates, and I encourage continued efforts in this direction.  Fortunately, our current approach, although far from perfect—and I think we’ve all criticized it in different ways—is not yet a “burning platform,” as we say in the IT world.  So there is time to work out some of these issues that we’ve been discussing.  I would argue that the calendar date right now is actually working better than maybe one would have expected.  Market expectations for liftoff currently align pretty closely with the Committee’s, and when the economic conditions have changed, market expectations for the date of liftoff have changed correspondingly.  That means that markets are not viewing our current policy as an unconditional commitment to a calendar date, and already we’re getting the effects of seeing the expected liftoff date work as an automatic stabilizer, which I think is the main goal of going to thresholds.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is discussing the benefits and potential challenges of using thresholds instead of calendar dates in forward guidance. The speaker acknowledges the potential pitfalls of thresholds but also encourages continued efforts to communicate in terms of economic conditions.


Passage number 39.
 MR. BULLARD.  I have one question for President Kocherlakota.  Can I interpret what you’re saying as strict inflation targeting. That is, would you expect—really, regardless of what you say about unemployment—that everything is going to show up in inflation anyway, so you   might as well just say, “I’m going to keep inflation within ½ percent of the target,” and not say anything about real variables at all.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: While Mr. Bullard is posing a question and seeking clarification, there is no explicit disagreement or contention evident in this passage.


Passage number 40.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Well, from a logical point of view, having an unemployment threshold is just another restriction on the provision of accommodation.  So having an unemployment threshold, from a strict logical interpretation, is merely one more set of conditions on keeping rates low.  It’s actually a rather hawkish provision to have an unemployment threshold. I’ll let you think about that.  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. No, it’s true.  As long as you really obey the 2.5 percent, you could make the unemployment trigger zero.  It doesn’t matter.  This is just an extra protection on the inflation side, really.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 41.
 MR. LACKER.  Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no indication of contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states that Mr. Lacker is addressing the Chairman or President Lacker.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 42.
 MR. LACKER.  But it precludes moving to maintain that and prevent expected inflation from rising above 2½. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, remember—I was thinking of President Kocherlakota’s original proposal with 2¼, which is about as close as our forecast error to the target.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lacker is expressing a different viewpoint than President Kocherlakota's original proposal. He mentions that he was thinking of a different target, indicating a disagreement on what the target should be.


Passage number 43.
 MR. LACKER.  I’m sorry. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota’s proposal at one point was to have an inflation trigger of 2¼, and I’m saying that using projected inflation of 2¼ as your trigger is pretty close to—that’s within our forecast error around the 2 percent target.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: In this passage, Mr. Lacker is providing a clarification or explanation of President Kocherlakota's proposal. There is no contention or disagreement being expressed.


Passage number 44.
 MR. LACKER.  Right.  But the unemployment condition precludes moving to prevent the forecast of inflation from moving outside that bound. PARTICIPANT.  That’s absolutely correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: In the passage, there is agreement between Mr. Lacker and the participant. The participant affirms that Mr. Lacker's statement is "absolutely correct," indicating consensus rather than contention.


Passage number 45.
 MR. LACKER.  That’s the point. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No, it doesn’t.  If you project it to be rising to 2¼ or above, then you tighten.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It consists of Mr. Lacker making a point and then responding to a statement.


Passage number 46.
 MR. LACKER. That’s not the way it’s worded. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The response "That's not the way it's worded" is simply pointing out a potential misinterpretation or error in the wording, without expressing disagreement or contention. The subsequent response "Okay" suggests an acceptance or acknowledgement of the statement.


Passage number 47.
 MR. STEIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me start by adding my thanks to the authors of the memo on this topic, which I thought was really very insightful; it helped me a lot.  My bottom line is, I continue to see the intellectual appeal of numerical thresholds, and I still have an open mind about them.  But I will say that between the memo and conversations with various people, I think I’m starting to better appreciate some of the limitations as well.  Also, and importantly, I feel as though we succeeded beyond at least my own expectations with our reformulation of the guidance at the last meeting in that we were able to quite effectively communicate a shift in our reaction function without relying on numerical thresholds.  So I guess that takes away some of the urgency that I might have otherwise felt. On the assumption that we do go forward with trying to think about design, the first fork in the road I came to was the question of, are we trying to develop a commitment technology or a communication strategy. If you read much of the academic literature, you find that the payoff is very much about commitment.  The payoff comes from being able to essentially bind yourself to something that you would be tempted to renege on ex post.  Or a weaker version of that would be, you can’t literally bind yourself perfectly, but you can set up costs in terms of loss of reputation if you go back on your commitment.  Now, I think if this is your framework, if you’re going for commitment of this sort, I think you’re naturally going to be drawn to relatively sharp, verifiable formulations—go easy on the escape hatches. For example, observed inflation, as a number of people have pointed out, is better than our own forecast of inflation because it’s a verifiable item and you can see when we’ve reneged in some sense.  So the principle here is, if you’re going for commitment, you can’t “tie yourself to the mast” with the kinds of “loose ropes” that leave you a lot of wiggle room. Now, of course, I think commitment has its downsides, as the memo points out, in the sense that you lose the ability to adjust to a variety of omitted contingencies, if you will. I agree with others who’ve pointed out that, “I don’t find these errors around the structural rate of unemployment to be a super-compelling worry, because that’s exactly what the inflation threshold is there for.”  On the other hand, there’s other stuff not in the model.  In my mind, the financial stability issues are important.  We don’t really understand them all that well, and we’re talking about a pretty long horizon, so I’m concerned. I agree with President Kocherlakota that monetary policy would be a blunt tool, but it needs to be compared with the other tools in our toolbox, some of which may be blunt or untested or otherwise not up to the job.  So I guess I prefer the idea of keeping a little bit of an open mind.  Moreover, I think one can take only so much comfort from what a model can tell us about what we give up with commitment, because what you give up is the ability to react to unforeseen contingencies, and that’s the stuff that’s left out of the model almost by definition.  So there’s a little bit of a bias that one wants to be wary of there. An alternative view—and I think this is the view that Vice Chairman Dudley was expressing—is that we’re not really going for commitment, but rather, we have a time-consistent reaction function, and we’re just trying to communicate aspects of this reaction function as clearly and credibly as possible.  So I’m more comfortable with this formulation.  Now, in this case, I think numbers can be helpful.  At the same time, they don’t strike me as necessarily indispensable.  If you do use them, it would make sense to use them in a somewhat looser way.  I don’t think that the imperative to use verifiable constructs is as strong, so you could, for  example, think about inflation forecasts as opposed to inflation.  And I think it’s interesting— again, my views on this have been strongly colored by how the market reacted to our September statement—that with regard to open-ended QE, where we’re using effectively a qualitative reaction function, it was apparently extremely credible—at least directionally credible, maybe not the subtleties of it.  It was quite credible in a verbal sense.  So that’s just worth bearing in mind.  Again, I’m still open to the idea, although with a little bit of skepticism. In designing it, I do want to be wary of a situation where we use numbers in a way that doesn’t really add much to where we are now already—which is, we’ve made considerable progress in terms of how we communicate—and, at the same time, set ourselves up to bear costs in terms of lack of flexibility.  So I think it’s important to strike that balance. Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Powell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses their appreciation for the memo and their open-mindedness about numerical thresholds. They also discuss their thoughts on commitment and communication strategies. The speaker acknowledges the limitations and downsides of commitment but also raises concerns about unforeseen contingencies and the need for flexibility. They also mention the possibility of using numbers in a looser way and discuss the credibility of a qualitative reaction function. Overall, the passage seems to be a thoughtful exploration of different perspectives and considerations.


Passage number 48.
  [Laughter] MR. TARULLO.  Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Yes.  Governor.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The presence of laughter suggests a positive and lighthearted atmosphere rather than disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 49.
 MR. TARULLO.  If I can enter Arrow theorem country just for a minute here, I heard several of our colleagues express a preference for qualitative thresholds, but I want to be sure I understood their position.  Is your position that, given that the effective choice may be or already is between the date and moving toward quantitative thresholds, you would prefer to stick with the date.  I think I heard Jeff, Charlie, Jim, and Richard for qualitative thresholds.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention in the passage. The speaker mentions that some colleagues prefer qualitative thresholds while others prefer quantitative thresholds, indicating a disagreement or contention among them.


Passage number 50.
 MR. LACKER.  How about neither.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 51.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  You’ve got to pick something.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any conflicting ideas or arguments. It simply states the need to make a choice without presenting any contrasting viewpoints or opinions.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 52.
 MR. TARULLO.  Yes, if you’ve got a choice of two things—that’s why I said it’s Arrow theorem country in a way; we’ve got the date, and if we’re not going to change from the date,  we’re going to stay with the date.  I think I heard all four of you saying implicitly you prefer staying with the date rather than going to quantitative thresholds, but I wanted to be sure I understood.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. While all four individuals mentioned prefer staying with the date, it is implied that there is a difference in opinion regarding the use of quantitative thresholds. Some may believe in using them, while others may not be in favor of them.


Passage number 53.
 MR. LACKER. I’m less averse to the date than I am to thresholds.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses a personal preference but does not argue or contradict any other opinion.


Passage number 54.
 MR. TARULLO.  Yes, that’s what I thought.  Okay.  And that’s true for all four of you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing agreement with an assumption made by someone else.


Passage number 55.
 MR. BULLARD.  Yes, and I’ll just add one thing, which didn’t really come out around the table here:  On the quantitative easing side, we already have the language that I would prefer to have also for the interest rate.  So I would say that you could align the two and then have it be the same way. I think that’s something that didn’t come up a lot here, only a little bit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Bullard is simply adding a point that he feels was not fully discussed or emphasized. He suggests aligning the language used for quantitative easing with the language used for interest rates.


Passage number 56.
 MR. PLOSSER.  To put in my two cents’ worth, I would rather have us move toward the qualitative nature describing our reaction function, keep the date for now, and gradually transition to the point where we could substitute the qualitative reaction function and get rid of the date. That may take some time, but I think that’s where we ought to be trying to get to, not to thresholds.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Plosser is simply expressing his personal preference and suggesting a gradual transition towards substituting the qualitative reaction function and eliminating the date in the future.


Passage number 57.
 MR. FISHER.  I think, Danny, since you mentioned me as well, that the Chairman did a pretty good job in the press conference. He said we know we’re not there yet, but he didn’t lay out a number, and to me that’s a qualification.  It’s a qualitative way to express ourselves.  I want to refine that somewhat.  We’re trapped with the date, and then we keep having to move it out.  Or we’re going to try to move it in, and it sends a signal.  Everybody has talked about that.  I just don’t think that having these specific numbers is a better outcome than what we already have. I don’t like what we already have, but I don’t think it’s a better outcome.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker agrees with the Chairman's statement and explains their own perspective on the matter, highlighting that they do not think having specific numbers is a better outcome than the current situation.


Passage number 58.
 MR. TARULLO.  That’s what I was trying to discern.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Tarullo, is simply stating that he was trying to understand something.


Passage number 59.
MR. FISHER.  And I want to ask about the time line here, Mr. Chairman, but I would urge us to go very slowly, as many people have said at this table.  In contemplating this thing, I don’t rule it out, but in the meantime, what you said in the last press conference was pretty good at giving a sense that we’re not there—we’re thinking about the unemployment issue.  But that’s as far as I would wish to go right now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses agreement with the Chairman's statement from the last press conference and suggests that they should focus on the unemployment issue for now.


Passage number 60.
  MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Tarullo is expressing gratitude to the chairman, indicating a positive tone in the conversation.


Passage number 61.
 MR. EVANS.  Sensing the warm feeling for qualitative state contingency in the language in our current statement about substantial improvement in labor markets, I feel similarly about that, but I want to point out that I would guess most people’s expectations were that we would stop asset purchases before we got to the point where we’d want the funds rate to lift off.  So we need a second qualitative description of “substantial” substantial improvement in labor markets. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  I think most people agree that in principle, the state-contingent approach is better.  What I heard was a continuum:  people who want a qualitative approach to those who would prefer the quantitative approach.  Interestingly, regarding those who wanted the quantitative approach, the one thing that I thought there might be a lot of debate about—the numbers—actually, most people were okay with those particular numbers.  I understand there’s now a wide range of views.  I think what we ought to do is huddle again with the staff and see if there are ways to provide the qualifications; the additional information; and the other kind of material that can satisfy some of you who are concerned about the rigidity, the lack of clarity, whatever, associated with this kind of approach.  I think the best way to do it is to try to write something down and then see how people react to it, but we’ll try to do that in the intermeeting period.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their own thoughts and suggestions, but there is no indication of disagreement or debate from others.


Passage number 62.
   MR. FISHER.  May I ask, Mr. Chairman—in terms of your own concept of the time line of conducting and maybe completing this discussion, what do you have in mind. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It depends on what the reaction is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is merely asking for clarification on the timeframe of conducting and completing the discussion. The response "It depends on what the reaction is" suggests that the timeframe will be determined by the reaction received.


Passage number 63.
 MR. FISHER.  So that would be the next step, and then we’d see. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Right.  That would be the next step, but we’ll try to do that well in advance of the next meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both speakers are in agreement regarding the next step in their plan.


Passage number 64.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Why don’t we take a break and come back at four o’clock.  Coffee is available. [Coffee break] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  I hope everybody is refreshed.  Financial developments—let me turn to Simon Potter.  Simon.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply providing information about a break and the next topic of discussion.


Passage number 65.
 MR. POTTER. Our expectations are shown here in 13.  That’s based on Tealbook assumptions of where interest rates will be, so that might differ a little bit from what some people in the market expect.  We’re reasonably confident three to six months ahead in what the issuance will be, and then issuance starts to decline. We looked at this quite a lot in the intermeeting period.  We were surprised in September about how much reinvestment we had, and that was because refis were a little bit stronger. I would imagine that we’ll know more early in the year. It partly depends on how much traction the policy will have and what happens in the housing market. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply discusses expectations and observations related to interest rates, issuance, reinvestment, and the housing market.


Passage number 66.
 MR. EVANS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Simon, in chart 4, on inflation expectations, I have a question that I could have asked years ago.  I’m never quite sure what the answer is.  How does the five-year, five-year-forward breakeven inflation rate compare with our long-run inflation objective of 2 percent on headline PCE. I ask in part because I’ve read commentaries of various people who try to relate the two, and wonder how it’s calibrated. I’m going to guess that one answer is, it’s the CPI, not the PCE.  Then the other is, it’s inflation compensation versus inflation expectations, I think, in spite of the heading on this chart.  Any information you could provide on that would be helpful.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is asking a question and seeking clarification.


Passage number 67.
 MR. POTTER.  Well, thank you for that.  The heading of the chart should have said “Inflation Compensation.”  It is a CPI-linked instrument that we use.  So you could think of the inflation objective mapping from the 2 percent PCE to somewhere between 2.3 and 2.5 percent.  Inflation compensation means that this is not just inflation expectations; it includes an inflation risk premium.  How you look at that inflation risk premium is important to understand.  For the history, we excluded the period during the financial crisis because we felt that was biased downward a little bit.  So the five-year, five-year forward got reasonably high but then came back down, and the 2.81 is not unusual if you plotted the time series.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention any disagreement or contention. It primarily presents information about inflation compensation and the exclusion of a biased period during the financial crisis.


Passage number 68.
 MR. EVANS.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 69.
  So for the translation, you’d back off at least—MR. POTTER. Put 2.3 to 2.5, and then you have to decide what the inflation risk premium would be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is discussing the steps involved in a translation, specifically mentioning the interest rates and inflation risk. They are not expressing any conflicting opinions or engaging in an argument.


Passage number 70.
 MR. EVANS.  Any thoughts on the order of magnitude or the time variation of the risk premium.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: no


Passage number 71.
 MR. POTTER.  I think the Board staff and staff in New York have models where they try to estimate the inflation risk premium.  I believe what we found is most of this movement is in the inflation risk premium.  I’m not sure what the Board staff found.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 72.
 MR. WILCOX.  And important movements on liquidity risk premiums, too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that there are important movements on liquidity risk premiums.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 73.
 MR. POTTER.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement indicated in the passage because someone named Mr. Potter is responding with "Yes," which suggests a contradictory response or differing opinion.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 74.
 MR. EVANS.  Did I miss a magnitude.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes.
Explanation: The question suggests that the speaker might have missed a magnitude, indicating there may be a disagreement or discrepancy in the information or understanding.


Passage number 75.
  Did you mention— MR. POTTER. There’s a liquidity aspect to this.  You might expect non-Treasuries to move more quickly than index-linked ones, and that’s something that can exaggerate movements on the day of the FOMC announcement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a statement explaining the liquidity aspect and potential exaggeration of movements on the day of the FOMC announcement.


Passage number 76.
  So the magnitude— MR. EVANS. A couple of tenths.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply providing additional information or clarification.


Passage number 77.
 MR. POTTER. The presentation I saw had expected inflation about 1.9 percent on the CPI basis.  The liquidity premium could be larger than that.  I would go for more like 30 or 40 basis points.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply suggesting their own opinion or estimate for the liquidity premium, which is not dis


Passage number 78.
 MR. WILCOX.  In terms of recent data, if you happen to have your handy Tealbook data sheets in front of you, the TIPS-based measures are shown on page 26 in the rose-colored segment. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not mention any contention or disagreement. It simply provides information about the location of TIPS-based measures in a data sheet.


Passage number 79.
 MR. FISHER.  Simon, you mentioned, in reference to number six on exhibit 1, a limited amount of pass-through in terms of the primary mortgage rate.  I suppose the question is, would   you expect this to increase as we pass through time.  You mentioned some of the offsets, which we discussed at the past meetings, the increase in the fees and so on.  After all, this is our objective.  We’re obviously not working for Wells Fargo or J.P. Morgan and have 40 percent of the market.  We’re working for the American people, and the objective in terms of efficacy is what happens to people actually taking out mortgages.  So I would expect the MBS pricing to, over time, work its way into the mortgage market.  I’m just curious from your standpoint as a market operator how you view this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for clarification and expressing their expectation regarding the pass-through of mortgage rates.


Passage number 80.
 MR. POTTER.  The models that we have, which try to look at the recent relationship between the secondary rate and primary rate, would suggest we’ve seen most of the pass-through.  However, some of the structural features that you pointed out and other people have pointed out might suggest that we could see more competition in the market.  I think Governor Duke pointed that out, that this is one area where the banks are actually making money.  That would then disturb the relationship we’ve estimated over the past few years.  You might see more pass-through, but on the models we have right now over the past two years, most of the pass-through is there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges that there are different points of view and considerations, but there is no explicit disagreement or argument.


Passage number 81.
 MR. FISHER.  Maybe, Mr. Chairman, we could just monitor that as we go through time in terms of the efficacy of the program. Then regarding your chart 8 and your comment that net issuance is expected to be negative:  One of the things I’m a little bit concerned about in terms of composition is that you have private sector issuance being positive, and unless you correct me, I think it’s correct that we’ve had a significant uptick in junk issuance.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing concern and seeking clarification on a point.


Passage number 82.
 MR. POTTER.  High yield, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Potter simply states "High yield, yes" without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 83.
 MR. FISHER.  I mean really significant, CCC-rated and worse.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states a statement by Mr. Fisher regarding the significance of a certain rating.


Passage number 84.
  VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  A lot of refinancing though of existing obligations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage simply states that there is a lot of refinancing of existing obligations happening. There is no indication of any contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 85.
 MR. FISHER.  Yes, and then, of course, the ABS market has become pretty attractive. Yesterday I saw for the first time asset-backed securities secured by sales of ATVs, or all-terrain vehicles, these little four-wheel gizmos that people like to drive around a ranch in; and then Target just sold off their credit card business.  There are two ways to look at this.  One is that this is helping.  The other is, as a market operator, at least from my background, that these are signs of concern.  We may be getting a little bit of froth.  My question is:  Might we be seeing a little froth in certain markets and maybe, again, could we track this over time from the standpoint of financial red lights or financial stability issues.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker presents two different ways to interpret the situation - one is that the developments are helping, while the other suggests concern and frothiness in the markets. The speaker's question further emphasizes the potential disagreement or different perspectives on the matter.


Passage number 86.
 MR. POTTER. That’s clearly a concern we’ve heard from some market participants— that we would see more reaching for yield that could produce some distortions.  So far it seems to be in pretty small segments of the market, so I don’t think it’s something we should worry about.  We should monitor it quite carefully.  In terms of the ABS you pointed out, I think most of us would think that’s a reasonably good sign if we’re getting more securitized loans out there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It focuses on the concerns of some market participants and the speaker's perspective on the issue.


Passage number 87.
 MR. FISHER.  The hottest market right now is, of course, the auto market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that the hottest market currently is the auto market without opposing or contradicting any other information.


Passage number 88.
 MR. POTTER.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only mentions Mr. Potter without providing any further information or context. Without any additional information, it is not possible to determine whether there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 89.
 MR. FISHER.  Well, anyway, if you would be kind enough maybe next time to give us a little presentation with some breakdown I would be grateful.  I think it would be helpful.  Thank you very much. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Seeing no further questions I need a vote to ratify domestic market operations.  No objections. [No response]  Okay.  Thank you.  Let’s turn to item 3, and I’ll call on David Wilcox to introduce the economic and financial situation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing gratitude for a potential future presentation and then moving on to the next topic.


Passage number 90.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  David, while we were going over the Tealbook, we were trying to understand the staff’s assumption of the duration of the MBS purchases and your assumption related to any continuation of Treasury purchases after the expiry of the MEP, and how that connects to your estimate of 2013 employment gains.  I wonder if you could just clarify that.  That’s in the context of how we assess as a Committee substantial improvement or the lack thereof in the outlook for employment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Instead, Mr. Lockhart is seeking clarification and understanding of the staff's assumptions.


Passage number 91.
 MR. WILCOX.  We engaged in a fair amount of scriptural analysis, I think, just like outside people did by trying to discern exactly what it was that you meant by substantial improvement in labor market outlook. We interpreted “outlook” as having a concordance to “forecast,” and then we projected forward.  Now, the truth of the matter is we had a pretty flat likelihood function, having gone through that sort of textual analysis.  I think there’s a plausible case to be made that by the middle of next year, the Committee might be prepared to declare itself as seeing a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook as distinct from measures of employment conditions on the ground prevailing at that time.  The way that I would build the case for that is that by the middle of next year, if there’s any mercy in the world, the fiscal cliff should be at that point substantially in the rear view mirror.  The uncertainty related to that should be lifting.  By that point on our baseline narrative, European policymakers should have begun to more assertively put in place the kinds of policy steps that will definitively put that crisis in the healing process. And so although it’s still the case that the more substantial acceleration in GDP would remain a forecast at that point, I think it’s consistent with the Committee’s language, as we imagined it, to believe that those conditions—the elimination of some of the downside tail risks,   and the pulling forward by nine months of that period of more substantial acceleration in activity—would provide the basis for the Committee at that point to declare a cessation of purchases, and that the conditions had been met.  That said, it was a tough call.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It discusses different interpretations and possibilities, but there is no direct disagreement or argument presented.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 92.
 MR. LOCKHART.  I don’t hear you pointing to real evidence in the employment markets per se in the first half, which, if I read the Tealbook correctly, continued at a fairly muted level of job creation, basically similar to the fourth quarter of this year; is that correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. 

Explanation: The speaker, Mr. Lockhart, is questioning the person on the other end about their lack of evidence in the employment markets in the first half of the year. He disagrees with their statement or point of view by challenging them to provide real evidence to support their claim.


Passage number 93.
 MR. WILCOX.  Yes, that’s right.  Bill, do you want to add anything.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Wilcox simply asks Bill if he wants to add anything.


Passage number 94.
 MR. WASCHER. To put some numbers on it, as David mentioned, we think the underlying pace of private payroll growth is going to be about 130,000 in the fourth quarter, and we’re expecting that to continue with that same pace in the first quarter and then gradually pick up. In the second quarter, we have about 160,000 and then moving up to about 200,000 by the end of the year. At that point, we decided that the outlook will have improved enough for asset purchases to end.  The employment numbers are starting to pick up to above 150,000 and move up over the course of the second half to about 200,000.  Given that outlook we made the decision in the forecast to assume that asset purchases would end at that point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement of the speaker's forecast and their reasoning for when they believe asset purchases should end based on the projected employment numbers.


Passage number 95.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The phrase "Thank you" does not imply any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses gratitude.


Passage number 96.
 MR. ENGLISH.  In terms of what’s built into the forecast, we’re assuming that the purchases of Treasuries under the MEP are continued after the end of the MEP at the end of the year, and the MBS purchases continue all through June of next year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. It simply states a forecast assumption without presenting any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 97.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing gratitude.


Passage number 98.
  MR. FISHER.  Steve, you may remember some time ago that WikiLeaks had this release of a cable and a conversation with now Vice Premier Li when he was chairman of the Communist Party of Liaoning, which is a northeastern province in China, and they were asking how he and the Politburo got the best measurement of economic growth; he referred to rail shipments and electricity consumption as well as lending activity. We’ve been tracking this.  I’m sure you have as well, but I have a question at the end of making a few data points.  One is that electricity consumption, at least in the series that we’ve been able to construct, is expanding at about 2 percent—not a very robust number.  If you look at freight in terms of train shipments, it’s down 7 percent, and that’s the lowest we can construct going all the way back to 2003.  And last, intercoastal shipping activity has dropped 34 percent, year to date.  So I’m wondering if we are able to parse from that how much is related to fallow export activity—you mentioned Europe, which is certainly hurting, and the slowdown elsewhere—or what it might tell us about their own domestic activity and how weak things really are.  Because if you look at the indicators that I just mentioned, the growth rate, which I’ve always found suspect, would seem to be much less than what they’re reporting.  I wonder what your take is on that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any statements that could be considered contentious or disagreement. It simply presents data points and asks for the speaker's opinion on the indicators and their implications.


Passage number 99.
 MR. KAMIN.  Sure.  First of all, we’ve been very alert to two issues that are related. One of them is whether the official GDP data understate the true growth of the economy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating that the speaker has been alert to two related issues.


Passage number 100.
 MR. FISHER.  Overstate or understate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The word "overstate or understate" refers to the act of exaggerating or diminishing something. However, in the given passage, no specific information or viewpoint is mentioned to determine whether there is contention or disagreement. Therefore, there is no contention or disagreement present in the passage.


Passage number 101.
 MR. KAMIN. Oh, I’m sorry.  Overstate.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply apologizing for misspeaking and thanking someone.


Passage number 102.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. Mr. Fisher is simply expressing gratitude.


Passage number 103.
MR. KAMIN.  And second, as a related matter, has the slowdown in China been steeper than the official data would suggest.  We actually developed these issues, and we have a box in the Tealbook that addresses them, and I’ll just mention some of the issues. First of all, electricity production, indeed, has tailed down over time, but it is reasonably well correlated with the ups and downs of official Chinese GDP growth.  In fact, in the third quarter, at least by our seasonal adjustment estimates, it seems to have popped up a little bit.  By that metric, the movements in the official data don’t seem broadly out of line, although we haven’t looked at your freight cars or some of the other issues.  Actually, since a particular weak spot for the Chinese economy has been exports, I could easily imagine that some indicators that are most correlated with export activity could show steeper declines than GDP growth generally, so that’s one area of investigation we’ve pursued. Another focus of our analysis has been to note that we’ve used a short-term forecasting model that relates GDP growth to three indicators:  retail sales, import growth, and industrial production.  Over time, that has tracked official GDP growth pretty well in terms of its ups and downs.  If the Chinese authorities were fudging the data to an exceptional degree lately, they’d have to be doing it not only with GDP growth, but also to these other indicators, which I won’t rule out as impossible, but that seems less likely. One final point is, as I mentioned, since the Tealbook was put to bed, the Chinese released new data for GDP in the third quarter, which looked stronger.  That was, indeed, consistent with the stronger tone of retail sales and IP data that they released at the same time. By our model, we actually would be looking at quarter-to-quarter annual rate GDP growth of like 8½ percent, but the actual data suggest 8 percent, and we’re going with that. So long story short, for obvious reasons we’re not 100 percent confident about the official data that the Chinese have released, but we haven’t been able to find any smoking guns, as it were, that the data are basically distorting in a significant way our view as to what’s happening.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any explicit contention or disagreement. The speaker is discussing their analysis of the data and expressing some uncertainty and caution about the official data from China, but there is no direct contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 104.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Fisher is simply expressing his gratitude.


Passage number 105.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. One other point on the whole electricity–GDP conundrum in China.  There is some evidence that the industrial sector is a really big user of electricity relative to the overall economy, and so to the extent that the manufacturing sector is hit by the slowdown in Europe, for example, you’re going to see a disproportionate decline in electricity relative to overall GDP.  What seems to be happening in China is that manufacturing activity is under some pressure, but if you look at the household sector, consumption seems to be doing quite well.  So if you break the electricity consumption down by sectors, you can reconcile the weak electricity consumption.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply providing an analysis of the relationship between electricity consumption and GDP in China.


Passage number 106.
 MR. FISHER.  But the answer to my question is that it’s export-related more than it is domestic growth–related.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply clarifying that the answer to their question is more focused on export-related factors rather than domestic growth-related factors.


Passage number 107.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes, it’s industrial-related.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there does not appear to be any contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply stating that the topic being discussed is related to industry.


Passage number 108.
 MR. KAMIN.  But even without going to that degree of decomposition, it’s not obvious just from the electricity numbers alone, just in aggregate, that they’re indicating a much more rapidly slowing economy than we’ve seen. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  If everyone is willing, maybe we could get to our economic go-round.  It would be terrific if we could do that all today.  I ask everyone, to the  extent you can, to keep your interjections crisp and concise.  And with that I will start with a recognized expert in the field of crisp and concise interjections, President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply a request for participants to keep their comments brief and concise.


Passage number 109.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would just start with a parenthetical comment.  Not to relitigate our previous discussion, but it’s notable that if staff who sits in on the meeting have trouble interpreting qualitative guidance and people that are very informed investors, as Simon highlighted, have a very different interpretation of qualitative guidance, it does highlight the challenges in communication of relying solely on qualitative guidance. In terms of the economic outlook, I agree with Governor Stein’s comments in that I was somewhat surprised by how much our actions at the previous meeting affected financial markets. While the policy affected asset prices in a way similar to conventional policies—lowering mortgage and bond rates, weakening the dollar, and increasing stock prices—the big surprise was how much the mortgage rate declined and how little the Treasury rate responded.  My interpretation of this is that markets had expected us to do more with Treasury purchases, but that our anticipated mortgage purchase program was more substantial than anticipated.  While it is too soon to know the broader economic impact, the initial response has been quite encouraging. Qualitatively, discussions with community bankers since our action have highlighted that in New England, refinance activity has been energized, and most banks are also seeing a higher volume of purchase activity, presumably, in part, as a result of our action. They have also noted that they are now funding more construction loans with financially strong builders, and that those builders seem to have no difficulty selling new homes.  Given that most New England states have unemployment rates below the national average and are seeing home price increases in many markets, this is exactly what I would have hoped from our policy actions.  We are   providing significant support to a nascent housing market recovery.  The Mortgage Bankers Association data on refinance and purchase loans nationally seem broadly consistent with what I am hearing more qualitatively from contacts. In discussions with college presidents, I’m hearing an increased willingness to start building projects.  Some colleges report endowments at or above 2006 levels, and with the very low interest rates, they are beginning to start building projects in part because of the low cost of funds and cost of construction, along with more faith in the recovery.  That some colleges are using debt finance rather than waiting for capital campaigns reflects a response to our actions of pushing long rates down. A third area that has been positively affected by low rates is car sales. Banks report that they have lowered auto rates, and consumers do seem to be responding.  Similarly, auto dealers I’ve spoken to believe that low auto loan rates are having a positive effect on auto sales.  Thus, more stimulative, unconventional policy is having an effect, and the supposition that further unconventional policies would not influence economic growth does not seem consistent with what we have seen to date. Another benefit of our open-ended action is that there seems to be more confidence that tail risks will be mitigated by our open-ended monetary policy tied to economic outcomes.  Consumer and housing activity appear to be picking up, and while there are many factors that influence household expectations, I do think our action is playing an important role.  The early October rise in the Michigan consumer sentiment index, especially the rebound in the expectations component, seems consistent with diminishing uncertainty on the part of consumers. However, firms seem more influenced by the continuing uncertainty surrounding the U.S. fiscal situation and international economic problems in Europe and China.  Thus, unlike the earlier stages of the recovery, firms are lagging while households are leading the recovery. If some of the uncertainty is removed at the end of this year, I can imagine getting a stronger and more sustained recovery in 2013.  However, both our policy action and this improved sentiment can easily be swamped by fiscal policy mistakes either here or abroad. Because our actions are having the anticipated positive effect, I have, as a result, raised my own forecast for economic activity.  However, it will still be many years before we are back to full employment.  To avoid further labor market scarring, I believe it is appropriate for us to continue to take strong action that will reduce the time it takes to more fully utilize resources in the economy.  That action should continue into next year, it seems to me, but we will turn to that topic tomorrow. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing agreement and support for the actions and policies of the Federal Reserve.


Passage number 110.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Most of our contacts in the Sixth District continue with their wait-and-see approach tied to broader concerns about well-recognized uncertainties.  A few more of our directors said they anticipate some greater deceleration in the short term than they expressed at the time of the previous FOMC meeting. For example, a director from the country’s second-largest retailer, a national home improvement chain, said that despite the fact they had experienced better-than-expected sales recently, they are budgeting a slowdown in 2013 tied directly to fiscal cliff effects. In our board meetings and advisory councils, we continue to hear reports of deferred projects across several sectors.  While this does not bode well for demand in the short term, it   suggests there may well be a significant level of pent-up investment activity that will take shape quickly once greater clarity regarding the near- to medium-term outlook is established. Regarding the national outlook, my GDP growth projection aligns pretty closely with the Tealbook over the next few quarters, but I’m more cautious about an acceleration in growth materializing in the medium term.  The reason I asked the questions earlier of David Wilcox is I note that the Tealbook sees an acceleration beginning mid-2013, and it appears this acceleration triggers the staff’s assumed cessation of the LSAP3 after eight months.  Because my forecast has lower GDP growth toward the back end of the forecast horizon, I don’t have the same confidence that policy will have done its work by mid-2013. My outlook for inflation runs a little higher than the Tealbook, holding at the Committee’s longer-term objective, and my outlook for 2013 and 2014 year-end unemployment is essentially the same as the Tealbook, but the quarterly jobs growth stories differ enough to mention.  My projections assume relatively even jobs growth across the quarters, while the Tealbook shows a pretty steep acceleration starting in the back half of 2013, following on weaker numbers in the first half. I mention this because it raises in my mind—and again, was the reason for the question earlier—the basis for the Tealbook’s assumption of the LSAP stopping at midyear. I’d like to comment in this round on two questions related to the performance and outlook of the economy that I expect the Committee will confront in coming meetings.  In the intermeeting period we engaged a number of contacts across the Southeast to gather anecdotal observations on these questions.  The first question was about the housing sector and any perceived impediments to effective transmission of MBS-related monetary actions through the mortgage credit channel to the real economy.  Improvement in the housing market is gaining traction in my part of the country.  Builders and realtors report a bounce in construction and sales activity.  There was widespread agreement among bankers that HARP2 is making headway in addressing underwater mortgages for those that were current on their payments.  That said, the banking and real estate contacts report that several obstacles to stronger mortgage activity exist, including impaired credit quality of potential borrowers, conservative loan underwriting, and administrative backlogs. Regarding the transmission process through mortgage credit originators, my contacts indicate that a capacity problem does indeed exist.  The larger mortgage players have not committed sufficient resources to expand refi capacity because the refi business is not viewed as sustainable once rates begin to rise. It’s worth mentioning that a member of President Rosengren’s staff provided my staff with a preliminary analysis of pass-through from the secondary MBS markets to primary markets, and the work suggests—or at least our interpretation is—that there has been substantial but not complete pass-through from secondary to primary mortgage markets.  I think more analysis needs to be done to map pass-through from rates all the way to originations, closings, and upward pressure on house prices. The second question is related to labor market conditions in general, with a particular focus on elements that might be relevant to the Committee’s future assessment of sustainable improvement in the outlook for employment.  In the near future, the Committee is going to have to evaluate the outlook for employment looking at a range of data inputs, of course, but perhaps some attention to anecdotal information.  My comment is anecdotal, of course, but we continue to hear that some industries, notably the retail sector, are planning to increase the relative size of their part-time workforce in order to minimize the cost associated with mandated health care coverage.  One of my directors, the CEO of a multi-format national restaurant firm, recently made news by announcing his company’s intention to move to an increasing use of part-time employees in anticipation of implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Our home-improvement chain director has said the same thing.  This bears watching, I think, as we interpret the data on employment and labor markets, particularly as an alteration of the recent LSAP3 policy is considered.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It primarily consists of the speaker providing information and observations.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 111.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As I look at the Ninth District, I think that the economic tale is an unusually tangled one.  There are definitely positive signs.  In the Minnesota labor market, the number of job vacancies and the job vacancy rate recovered to their pre-recession levels.  At the same time, Minnesota’s unemployment rate was 5.6 percent in the second quarter of 2012, only about a percentage point higher than in the second quarter of 2007. There are also positive signs in the housing market.  According to the Case-Shiller index, housing prices in Minneapolis–St. Paul were about 6 percent higher in June than the year before.  But there are also reasons for concern.  Our business contacts report that their desire to engage in either cap-ex or hiring has declined significantly since the beginning of the year.  As you can probably guess, the one-word explanation for their caution is uncertainty, primarily about international demand and United States fiscal policy. This mixed picture is true at the national level as well.  In housing, the recent surge in housing starts is a positive element.  More important, at least from my point of view, housing prices seem to have begun to rise from what we hope is the bottom.  In the labor market we see signs of improvement, such as household employment having grown at about 180,000 per month over the past three months.  Measures of financial market uncertainty, such as the VIX and VVIX, remain low by post-2007 standards.  This month’s Michigan survey of consumersentiment jumped to levels not seen since the beginning of the recession.  That’s all on the positive side. On the negative side, manufacturing has slowed.  The Tealbook reports that nonresidential investment is likely to be slow in the near term, and the NFIB survey of small business attitudes toward hiring has really a near-recessionary feel to it. Financial markets continue to exhibit levels of risk aversion that I would have to say are extraordinarily high.  The 20-year real TIPS yield is essentially zero.  This means that on the margin, investors do not see any investments better than giving up a unit of purchasing power today for a unit of purchasing power 20 years in the future.  Now, as somebody who has spent much of my life teaching about the time–value of money, I find this quite disheartening.  [Laughter]  Even though some observers view equity prices as being inexplicably high, the Tealbook documents that the equity risk premium is actually higher now than at any point in the past 20 years. My outlook for the national economy is reflective of this mixed picture.  My benchmark outlook is about the same as the Tealbook’s, albeit with slightly less economic growth and slightly more inflation in 2014, somewhat similar to what President Lockhart was saying. But I would say that the uncertainties of my benchmark outlook are much more important in my policy thinking than the outlook itself.  On the one hand, slowing international demand or a trip over the fiscal cliff would lead to downward pressure on both employment and prices in our own country. On the other hand, it is also possible that we could see a protracted increase in housing prices.  Such an increase would generate a welcome boost to median household net worth, there would be an increased demand for goods and services, and this would push upward on employment and prices.  So in my outlook I see a great deal of uncertainty about our rate of progress to our dual mandate objectives.  We need a way to communicate to the financial markets and to the public that we stand ready to be appropriately supportive in case of an adverse shock to employment and prices, while remaining appropriately vigilant against unduly high inflation.  In the next go-round I will discuss how, not surprisingly, a threshold policy would provide exactly that kind of communication.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker presents a mixed picture of both positive and negative signs in the economy, but expresses uncertainty about the outlook and the importance of uncertainties in policy thinking. This indicates a lack of agreement or consensus on the state of the economy and the appropriate policy response.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 112.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like President Pianalto, our own trimmed-mean work at the Dallas Fed indicates that inflation is well contained and is running at roughly a little bit below our 2 percent longer-term target; so inflation isn’t the issue.   I noted President Williams’s comments, and I listened to them very carefully.  I agree with him fully that China and Europe are a deep concern to at least those that operate globally.  I would add that for the first time, Steve Kamin, I am actually hearing of slow pays in China and lagging receivables. For example, in the case of Foxconn, which has 1 million employees—the way the semiconductor companies work with them is through a collection agency.  That collection agency is reporting slow pays from Foxconn.  You are seeing other similar signs of lagging in payments and cash flow issues.  There may be more there.  We just need to watch it.  But it adds to the angst in the business community.  Europe is already full of angst as you mentioned, and I am not going to comment further on that. Unlike President Williams, my corporate contacts continue to talk about the fiscal cliff, and the differentiation is as follows. It is one thing if measures are taken, particularly temporary measures, to avoid the fiscal cliff.  We all know that it would have at least a stay on the gross GDP impact.  The real issue is employment and how you plan and budget for employment.  And, again, citing the people that I speak to—which is a pretty good survey I think, including not just my directors, but a broader group—they continue to worry about whether or not they will be able to have specifics around which to plan not only expansion of cap-ex but also expansion of head count. President Kocherlakota mentioned the NFIB survey.  I have talked quite a bit about that publicly.  It is not very encouraging.  As one small business leader told me, it is very hard to build a railroad when you don’t know where you are going to be able to lay the tracks.  I think that still remains a problem.  And drilling down on this issue in terms of how corporations actually budget, in terms of payroll and the larger corporations’ job enhancing cap-ex, temporary solutions to the fiscal cliff do nothing but push out their budgeting cycle.  It is pretty clear, citing a direct quote from one of my most reliable corporate contacts, a large national operator, that already “strategic positioning steps for the second half of 2013, fourth quarter 2013, are being shelved.” My principal concern is employment.  It has been for a very long time.  I think that when you mentioned uncertainty, President Kocherlakota, that is still the operative word in the private sector.  And I don’t think we can take any relief from whether or not there is a short-term solution to the fiscal cliff.  What I care about is employment.  So we may not have the dent to GDP that we might fear.  But I do not think it is going to lead to more robust employment activity if we have temporary measures, which is what I expect. I would like to conclude, Mr. Chairman, with a comment that President Lockhart made because it’s not unimportant.  The restaurant industry claims that they have 1 out of 10 workers in the workforce.  I don’t know if that’s correct or not.  But the Affordable Care Act is not extended to people that work 30 hours or less.  What is interesting about that industry is the average restaurant worker works 48 hours.  Most of the restaurateurs and—I love this term—the casual dining establishments are actually taking steps to move their workers to less than 30 hours or to make them, in one way or another, temporary employees. This may screw around with the employment data for a while, which is why I mention it. I think President Lockhart is correct: We ought to pay attention to it.  It is not unimportant, if it is, indeed, that significant a portion of the workforce.  The Act may have an effect that is counter to what was originally planned by the authorities that framed it.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker disagrees with President Williams's comments about China and Europe not being a concern, and instead talks about slow pays and lagging receivables in China. The speaker also disagrees with the idea that temporary solutions to the fiscal cliff will lead to more robust employment activity, and expresses concern about the effect of the Affordable Care Act on the restaurant industry.


Passage number 113.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would like to lodge a protest against the banning of electronic devices in this room.  I have only a very faint memory of Tigers games when they have won the World Series, and I have no access to an electronic device.  [Laughter] However, I do remember that they won in 1968 and sometime in the early 1980s, which I suspect is not helpful for this Committee. But if I could interrogate President Williams, maybe I could get him to reveal that much of his statistics on San Francisco are due to New York.  [Laughter] That clouds the statistics.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It includes a statement of protest and a humorous comment, but there is no argument or conflict presented.


Passage number 114.
 MR. LACKER.  The New York Giants.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage as the sentence provided does not imply any conflicting opinions or debates.


Passage number 115.
 MR. EVANS.  At any rate, my outlook is not appreciably different from our September meeting.  At that time, I had already assumed the kind of additional policy accommodation that led the Tealbook to strengthen its forecast for medium-term GDP growth this round, and nothing in the recent data has caused me to change my basic views on the contours for growth or inflation over the medium term.  As President Williams and President Rosengren mentioned, I have also heard comments about how helpful our monetary policy actions in general have been for stimulating durable goods consumption growth and housing in general. As I talked with my business contacts this round, all of the commentary was very similar to September.  Several CEOs mentioned that business activity continues to be somewhat soft, but no one reported that a big drop-off was imminent.  In describing this slowness, several directors and CEOs made it a point to say that the current slowing is nothing like 2008 and 2009.  Thank goodness for easy comparisons.  For example, a large equipment manufacturer said that the near-term outlook was weak, as if air is coming out of the balloon.  But he expects a pickup in activity after the New Year. They were similarly concerned and hopeful about global prospects.  Growth is slowing now, but expectations are for a firmer recovery in 2013.  Several of my contacts noted that the slowdown in China appeared to be bottoming out and that the Chinese economy may be on the verge of a turnaround.  For example, Caterpillar reported receiving more requests for price quotes from Chinese customers, which is often a precursor to an increase in actual orders. With respect to the fiscal cliff risks in the United States, here, too, there was little new to report.  I had been expecting to hear a growing crescendo of concern running all the way to the end of the year.  But now I get the impression that businesses have already loaded up as much as possible on uncertainty and caution.  This fall, businesses have avoided making forward-looking commitments as much as is practical, as we have heard from others around the table.  Another heavy equipment manufacturer told me they put on hold any new spending in November and December.  They have plans in place to muddle through the rest of 2012, and then we will see where things stand in January.  After all, with demand so sluggish, the opportunity cost for waiting is about zero at the moment.  These kinds of comments suggest that we won’t be seeing any significant cap-ex or labor expansions in the fourth quarter. Similarly, our financial market contacts reported that many investors and nonfinancial businesses are accumulating cash.  Some of them are thinking, well, if we go over the cliff, then the cash can be used to buy a lot of distressed assets at bargain prices.  Alternatively, if the cliff is avoided, then the ensuing economic growth should present numerous investment opportunities. To sum up, I was glad to hear this round that businesses were not turning up the dial with regard to risk and uncertainty.  However, at the same time, it seems very unlikely that we will see any meaningful pickup in activity before the first quarter of 2013.  I hope we will have relatively favorable resolutions of the uncertainties here and abroad, and economic growth will accelerate, but the jury is still out.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lacker.

 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Broadly speaking, the Eighth District economy appeared to experience relatively strong growth of real personal income and consumption expenditures over the first half of 2012, compared with the growth seen during 2011. Since then, however, the District economy may have lost some momentum, as growth measured by state-coincident indicators has begun to slow.   Employment growth in the District’s 18 MSAs has recently lagged employment growth in the nation as a whole.  A few areas of the District seem to be doing relatively well, however.  Employment growth and housing activity have been brisk in the Louisville area, for example, and employment growth in Memphis has been on par with the nation. Anecdotal information from transportation firms in the District seems to provide some cause for concern.  The pace of activity in this industry seems to be slowing both globally and in the U.S.  These firms are growing cautious concerning the economic outlook.  The upcoming holiday season does not look particularly bright, according to these contacts. Nationally, I have been more optimistic concerning the second half of 2012 than the Tealbook.  Thanks to the spurt of relatively optimistic data, the Tealbook’s second-half assessment has now moved closer to my own, about 2 percent growth for the period. My concerns about a global slowdown remain prominent in my assessment of the U.S. economy.  However, I have become slightly more optimistic concerning the near-term outlook for Europe.  I think the next steps in the EMU drama have a reasonable chance of going smoothly, which may then push the current period of relative calm in global financial markets through the winter.  While I had been expecting a period of financial volatility during the September–October time frame, that volatility did not materialize.  This has given us a welcome respite from the European sovereign debt crisis, even if the core problems there remain unresolved.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 117.
 MR. STEIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In thinking about the outlook, I’ve also taken note of some of the same emerging bright spots that others have:  retail sales, consumer confidence, and housing starts.  I’ve been wondering how our policy actions from the previous meeting, particularly the MBS purchase component, might affect things in these areas going forward. Like President Rosengren, I was very struck by the market response to our September 13 announcement and, in particular, how much MBS rates moved relative to Treasuries. There are different measures of it, but one number that I remember was something like 40-plus basis points on the option-adjusted spread of mortgages to Treasuries in the first week after the announcement.  That’s a big, big number. To caricature what has happened—you could have had two theories going in.  One theory is that all that really matters is how much duration you’re taking out of the market and whether you do it by buying Treasuries or MBS is to some extent, secondary.  That’s how the FRB/US   and other models that we’ve used to think about it have approached it.  The other extreme, and of course, I’m just caricaturing, is you have a very highly segmented market, and there’s essentially a flypaper effect:  Where you touch it is where it’s going to stick.  And it seems like the data— when there’s this kind of outlier in the picture—have been trying to speak in favor of segmented markets, not as a general statement about the world, but at least in this particular case at this particular point in time. This leads to the question as to whether this market segmentation is something we should think is a good feature or is something that we didn’t really expect, and it means that things are not working out the way we intended and maybe we should think about tilting our mix back toward Treasuries because it’s somehow not working the way we expected.  You could argue it either way. My guess is if you’re a FRB/US literalist, you might say this is not the best thing in the world because of the lower elasticity of substitution—sure, I’m moving MBS rates by more, but that has to come at the expense of moving other rates by less, and housing is only a small sector of the economy, and maybe you’d rather have 10 or 15 basis points on the Treasury than 40 basis points on MBS.  You just don’t get enough if you think about the 40 basis points of MBS in a model.  However, if you adopt the view that I’ll associate with President Fisher, which is that the nonfinancial corporate world is probably pretty insensitive to further movements in the rates that they face, then market segmentation is in some sense your friend because it’s allowing you to focus your ammunition on a part of the world that is arguably more sensitive to financial conditions.  Even with the partial pass-through from the secondary to the primary, we have gotten a significant move, and as Governor Duke suggests, we may, with sustained pressure, hope to see more.  And even if those things don’t feel like a big thing in the model, I’m a little bit with Eric in thinking that right now the timing is such that a push in the right direction on housing might have a bigger effect than it otherwise might in other circumstances.  My general inclination is to think that we’ve actually gotten a little bit lucky with MBS purchases in the way that they’ve played out, and as a result, I’m a little more optimistic about the outlook in general and especially about those components of the outlook that are most closely connected to lower mortgage rates. Now, of course, this is all contingent on two things, and two things that are a little hard to know.  One is you have to believe that this effect on MBS spreads will be durable, and when you start thinking about very low elasticities of substitution, it may be that that elasticity is low in the short run.  But of course, in the long run, if there are these big movements in spreads, people are going to start hunting for yield elsewhere, and things may look different at a one-month horizon than they do at a one-week horizon.  We have seen some retracing of the effects. I don’t know how to quite think about this, but this a very important thing for us to think about in terms of the efficacy of the policies: Where is it going to stick at a more intermediate horizon.  And then, of course, second, there’s the whole issue of pass-through to the primary rate.  But I think if we do okay on both of these dimensions, and we push on this for a while, I can imagine that we would see some further positive momentum on consumer spending and housing. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thanks. Governor Powell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a reflection and analysis of the market response to previous policy actions and the potential effects on the economy. The speaker discusses different theories and perspectives but does not argue or disagree with any specific point.


Passage number 118.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Bill, I’m a little surprised by the interpretation of the size of the asset purchases in the dealer survey.  Looking at your chart, the dealer survey seems to be suggesting asset purchases on the order of alternative A. I think this is in line with the question that President Lockhart was asking yesterday.  This is leading me to be comfortable interpreting substantial improvement in line with alternative A.  If someone was of the opinion that we were expecting something like an alternative A, the substantial improvement language isn’t sufficient for that. Should we convey preferences for a different alternative.  I’m not quite sure how to make these judgments about alternative B versus alternative A since alternative B looked like pretty comfortable language in line with the dealer survey, but if I have to say I prefer alternative A, well, that’s what I would do. Thoughts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing surprise and seeking clarification on the interpretation of a dealer survey. There is no opposing view or argument presented.


Passage number 119.
 MR. ENGLISH.  I’m not sure if there was a question there or not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. It seems that Mr. English is expressing uncertainty about whether a question was asked or not, rather than engaging in a contention or disagreement.


Passage number 120.
  [Laughter] MR. EVANS.  Well, I’m surprised.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The laughter indicates a light-hearted and agreeable tone.


Passage number 121.
 MR. ENGLISH.  I wanted to present this information precisely because I thought the expectations in markets for the total amount of purchases are different than what we’ve written down in alternative B. I mean, we had to write down our alternatives before we had the dealer survey in hand.  The dealers’ expectations moved from immediately after the September meeting, when the Desk did kind of a flash survey, to the final dealer survey for this meeting.  So we ended up in a place where we were writing down balance sheet sizes that were, to us, reasonable—as we discussed yesterday—but are not that well aligned with what’s in markets.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply explaining the reasons behind presenting certain information and acknowledging that there may be differences between the expectations in markets and the alternatives that were written down.


Passage number 122.
 MR. EVANS.  Okay.  This seems like a normal type of adjustment that we were likely to get with qualitative types of guidance, I guess.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their opinion about the adjustment they expect to receive with qualitative types of guidance.


Passage number 123.
 MR. ENGLISH.  I think that’s right.  I think it’s a communications issue that would have to be addressed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. English is expressing his agreement and understanding of a communications issue that needs to be addressed.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 124.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you very much. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Raskin. MS. RASKIN.  Thank you.  Bill, I noticed that in all three alternatives, in the first paragraph in terms of our statement of current conditions we’re mentioning higher energy prices.  I’m wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on that decision, especially given the fact that in the go-round we actually heard very little about higher energy prices.  If, in fact, we were to make a change in this direction, I wonder whether we’d be maybe signaling more than we’re actually seeing. I just wanted to hear your thoughts on including energy prices.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. In the passage, MS. RASKIN is expressing disagreement or questioning the decision to include higher energy prices in all three alternatives. She points out that during the discussion, very little was said about higher energy prices, and suggests that including it in the statement may signal more than what is actually happening.


Passage number 125.
MR. ENGLISH.  The past couple of CPI releases, for example, have had pretty high headline numbers, and the reason underlying that is basically energy prices, and so it seemed to us that paragraph 1 is kind of a backward-looking statement of what have we seen over the intermeeting period, and it seemed appropriate to say something like this.  It was a little uncomfortable to stick with the language we had about inflation having been subdued because the headline numbers really weren’t that subdued over the past couple of months.  They were kind of to the high side, but they were to the high side for a very identifiable reason that we don’t think will persist.  So it seemed worth spelling out that we’ve seen some higher inflation, but it was due to energy prices, and this is not something people should be concerned about as an underlying trend in inflation. MS. RASKIN.  But, I mean, our current view may be that energy prices are not going to be higher going forward.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. Despite some discussion about how to express their views on inflation, there is no strong disagreement or contention in this passage. Instead, there is a conversation about whether or not to acknowledge recent higher inflation numbers and the underlying reasons behind them. The speakers ultimately agree that the higher inflation is due to energy prices and is not indicative of a persistent trend.


Passage number 126.
 MR. ENGLISH.  That’s right, but again, paragraph 1 is kind of describing the information that came in over the intermeeting period.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not display any contention or disagreement. It simply states that paragraph 1 describes the information received during the intermeeting period.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 127.
 MR. WILCOX.  Yes, Bill has got it exactly right. The past couple of CPI readings were pretty high.  For what it’s worth, we’ve got retail energy prices in the PCE price index increasing 10 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter and 11½ percent in the fourth quarter, and then we have that unwinding going forward from there.  Notwithstanding those pretty big energy prices numbers, we have top-line PCE inflation at 1¾ percent in the third quarter and just a shade over 2 percent in the fourth quarter.  So we think core inflation is going to be very moderate over the second half. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Duke.MS. DUKE.  Thank you. Actually I had a little bit of the same question about the difference between alternative B and alternative A.  Particularly when we get to the next meeting, we will be looking at exactly this decision:  Do we continue on with the Treasury purchases. I’m not sure I see in alternative A the indicator that goes from $750 billion to $1.2 trillion or whatever that magnitude of a jump is.  I think some discussion at least internally of how we’re thinking about what the total purchases would be or the stopping rules are would be important next time. But my big question has to do oddly with exit.  As our balance sheet gets bigger and bigger, we’re still assuming the same five-year time period for selling off the securities that are on the balance sheet.  So I’m beginning to wonder how feasible that is, particularly as our holdings of mortgage-backed securities get larger, and with us in the market buying, the market for mortgage-backed securities begins to shrink.  I don’t expect that you’re ready to talk about that today, but I’d be really interested in your thoughts about how continuing to build the balance sheet impacts the time period of exit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention in the passage between Mr. Wilcox and Governor Duke. Mr. Wilcox disagrees with Governor Duke's question about the difference between alternative B and alternative A. He also disagrees with her concern about the feasibility of selling off the securities on the balance sheet.


Passage number 128.
 MR. ENGLISH.  Simon, do you want to say anything about the pace of sales.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. MR. ENGLISH simply asks Simon if he has anything to add about the pace of sales.


Passage number 129.
 MR. POTTER. The Tealbook talks through this for you under alternative B.  What I have here would be for normalizing, I think.  We would sell, under alternative B, at about an $18 billion per month pace, the average sales pace.  And then, under alternative A, about $22 billion per month. MS. DUKE.  Really.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The individuals are discussing different alternatives and presenting different numbers, but they are not expressing opposing views or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 130.
 MR. POTTER.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 131.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing gratitude rather than opposing or conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 132.
MR. ENGLISH.  I think one issue that comes up, if the balance sheet gets bigger by more than roughly $750 billion, is that the exit principles say sales will take place over three to five years.  The staff has generally assumed five.  And normalization of the size of the balance sheet will take place over two to three years. If the sales take place over five years and the balance sheet gets more than about $750 billion larger, the normalization will take longer than three years.  So as you go from alternative B to alternative A, the normalization would take longer than the three years that we have written down in the exit principles. MS. DUKE.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: This passage does not include any direct contention or disagreement between the speakers. They are discussing potential concerns and considerations related to the balance sheet and the timing of normalization, but there is no explicit disagreement or argument between them.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 133.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Bill, this is a great chart, and it is a perfect lead-in to the communication discussion that we are going to have afterwards.  If you were to do this chart during conventional periods, where we are talking about a fed funds rate going up by 25 basis points, down 25 basis points, or staying the same, my guess is that we would see a lot of clumping around no change or 25 basis points either up or down depending on the circumstances. When I take the period of unconventional policy and multiply to convert the amounts to a fed funds rate, it seems like we are getting a huge spread on what people’s anticipations of monetary policy will be as a result of our qualitative guidance. I would be interested in two things.  One, is this chart an outlier relative to history. If we look at other periods where people are trying to make a guess about what our actions are, would we normally be this far away from expectations of what are probably the most informed people in the market.  Then, second, am I right in making my mental calculation that if I were trying to put this in terms of a fed funds rate up or down, this distribution is substantially wider than what we would see under conventional policy.  I mean, I should be happy, because this is implying   the market expects much more easing.  And given that that would be my bias, I might be happy that the market is willing to ease much more than it looks like at least the staff thinks our intentions are.  But it does raise some concern about if we are creating a lot of variance in our policy through our current communication strategy.  Any comments you have on that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Rosengren, expresses his concern about the discrepancy between market expectations and the Fed's intentions, suggesting that the Fed's communication strategy may be creating a lot of variance in their policy.


Passage number 134.
 MR. ENGLISH.  I haven’t done the work, but I think if you converted this to fed funds equivalents using various staff rules of thumb, you would indeed find a fair difference in the amount of easing the different broker–dealer firms are expecting over the next couple of years. And as to how unusual that is, I guess I am not sure.  I think even if we were in a world of conventional policy, and the market participants were looking at some trajectory for the rate— they thought there was going to be a tightening cycle or an easing cycle—there would probably be a fair amount of difference about the views of how large that tightening cycle would need to be or how large that easing cycle would have to be.  So I am not positive that this would be that unusual, but, nonetheless, we are in a situation where some participants see an expectation that there will be quite a lot of easing, and some not very much.  That range is indeed pretty large.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 135.
 MR. POTTER. I’d say that three meetings ahead it is really close. Most dealers assume that the Treasury purchases will continue at $45 billion and the MBS at $40 billion.  That’s very similar to the normal state of the world where the expectations of the fed funds rate over the next few meetings are very close to what we see in the Tealbook.  And then there’s this issue, as Bill pointed out, that as you go further out, there are different views on the reaction function, which is reflected here, and also on what the economic situation might look like that gives the dispersion. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents different views and expectations.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 136.
 MR. BULLARD.  Yes. I was just going to weigh in on this issue a little bit.  This is just that the staff forecast is based on an assumption of a little less accommodation than the market thinks.  If you wanted to incorporate that in, then you would have a little more aggressive forecast I guess.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement or contention in the passage. Mr. Bullard is stating that the staff forecast assumes less accommodation than what the market believes, suggesting a difference in opinion between the staff and the market.


Passage number 137.
 MR. ENGLISH.  It would be the forecast under alternative A, roughly, on my second exhibit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. English.


Passage number 138.
 MR. BULLARD.  As you say, you didn’t get the dealer survey until later in the process.  I think in the future, then, that would be probably incorporated into the main baseline of the Tealbook.  That’s how I would read this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Bullard is simply suggesting a potential improvement for incorporating the dealer survey into the main baseline of the Tealbook in the future.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 139.
 MR. ENGLISH. I think in the past we have been hesitant to just use whatever the market’s forecast is for policy in the staff forecast because we don’t necessarily agree with the market’s assessment of the outlook or your likely reaction function.  I wouldn’t want to say that no matter what, we are going to be writing down the market participants’ expectations for policy in the staff forecast.  We are going to have to make judgments about the outlook and about the likely policy response to that outlook.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. In this passage, Mr. English argues that there is disagreement or contention regarding the use of the market's forecast for policy in the staff forecast. He states that they have been hesitant to use the market's forecast because they don't agree with it.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 140.
 MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  Well, another way to look at it is the market is expecting more accommodation, but they don’t really have an appreciably different forecast from what we do.  They think it is going to be less effective than we do.  That’s why they think we are going to have to do more than what we think.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker suggests that the market expects more accommodation but disagrees on the effectiveness of this approach. They believe that more action will be needed compared to what the market thinks.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 141.
 MR. ENGLISH.  I guess I would want to look more carefully at the dealer survey to see whether that is the right way to interpret this, or whether the right way is that they have a different reaction function built in than we do.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. English, expresses a doubt or disagreement by stating that he wants to examine the dealer survey more closely to determine if the interpretation presented is correct or if there is a different reaction function at play.


Passage number 142.
 MR. POTTER.  They moved up their forecast for GDP and lowered the unemployment rate this time relative to September. They seem to think that the easing was effective. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  These priors look like they are pretty loosely held.  I think that if we choose to communicate differently, we can do that.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states the opinions and observations of Mr. Potter and President Kocherlakota.


Passage number 143.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes.  Thanks, Mr. Chairman.  I have just a few things to say.  One is to second what you just said.  If we want to communicate that our anticipation about the future path of policy is close to what the staff’s forecast is, well, we should figure out ways to do that. If we are happy with what the market participants currently expect, then I guess we should take that on board in the way we think about the future path of policy. I have a separate question, though.  At the end of paragraph 2 of alternative B, there is a line that says, “The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely would run at or below its 2 percent objective.”  This sentence made more sense to me at the previous meeting, as it referred to what would happen if we did not take action.  Now that we’ve taken action, it makes less sense to me.  I think it would be read, perhaps sloppily by people reading the statement, as saying that the Committee anticipates that under its current policy choice that inflation over the medium term likely would run at or below its 2 percent objective.  I guess my question is, what is the staff trying to communicate by including this sentence at the end of paragraph 2 of alternative B. Is it about the path of inflation without sufficient policy accommodation, or is it about the path of inflation under the path of policy described in alternative B.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges and agrees with the chairman's statement about the need to communicate the future path of policy. The speaker then raises a separate question about a sentence in the staff's forecast, seeking clarification on its meaning. This does not indicate any disagreement or argument, but rather a request for further explanation.


Passage number 144.
 MR. ENGLISH. It probably should be understood as the inflation outlook with sufficient policy accommodation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It suggests that the inflation outlook should be understood in a certain way given sufficient policy accommodation.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 145.
 MR. LACKER.  With.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage does not include any explicit statements or indications of contention or disagreement between the individuals involved.


Passage number 146.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  With.  Okay.  That’s fine.  Yes, I’m not sure it’s as clear as it could be on that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. Mr. Kocherlakota is expressing uncertainty about the clarity of something, but there is no indication of disagreement or conflict with anyone else.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 147.
  MR. LACKER.  And why is it “would”. It “would” be— CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes, I disagree with that.  It says, “without sufficient policy accommodation,” “might not,” and “would.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. In this passage, there is disagreement. Mr. Lacker disagrees with the statement and provides a counterargument by stating, "Yes, I disagree with that."


Passage number 148.
” MR. LACKER.  Those are conditional. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  They’re counterfactual.  They suggest that without the accommodation, you would get insufficient growth and inflation below target.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It simply presents an argument or statement made by Mr. Lacker regarding the conditional and counterfactual nature of some suggestions related to growth and inflation targets.


Passage number 149.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  So we are not describing what we think the path of inflation will be, given that we have provided sufficient accommodation. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That’s right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. Mr. Kocherlakota simply confirms that they are not describing the path of inflation.


Passage number 150.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Are we comfortable with that. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, we can discuss that in the go-round.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is suggesting discussing a topic, but there is no indication of disagreement or contention in the passage.


Passage number 151.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Okay. That’s fine. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Anyone else.  [No response]  All right.  Why don’t we go, then, to the go-round, and President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage provided does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 152.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I was happy to hear you refer to The New York Times this morning because that article confirms what many people at this table have been saying meeting after meeting. (Although in the upper right-hand side of that newspaper, it has always been proud to say, “All the News That’s Fit to Print,” there are cynics who would say, “All the News That’s Fit to Tint.”) I’m not quite sure if that is an affirmation or something that I should be worried about, having made the points that are made in that article, many of them this morning.  The underlying point is that, again, the macroeconomic effects of short-term solutions to the fiscal cliff may be one thing, but how it affects businesses’ confidence is another.  I’m glad you made that point.   I listened very carefully to the conversation around the table yesterday, and I want to make a couple of quick points because I went early and then actually listened to what other people were saying.  [Laughter]  Governor Tarullo made the point some time ago that we shouldn’t be reading statements, we should actually be having a dialogue.  I want to respond a little bit. We have to be very careful. I sensed—let me try to state this politely—a little bit of self-congratulation that QE3 had had such a great impact on the market.  Of course it has had a great effect on the fixed-income market.  This is a principle of hydrodynamics.  It’s Bernoulli’s principle.  If you shove a lot of volume through a narrow space, you’re going to get a faster flow. Simon gave a brilliant report yesterday—as he always does—and we saw the reaction in terms of the spreads and what has happened with MBS, and we had some conversations.  Governor Powell and I pointed out certain activity, at least in the CCC and lesser category—the junk bond sector—and some of the activities being seen were fully expected.  What I didn’t hear was that the stock market is actually down since we previously met by 3.2 percent.  It rallied the day after.  It’s off 3.6 percent since then. The real issue was raised by Betsy’s intervention, in my view.  I simply want to make the point that I have questions about the wealth effect, and I would like to see further studies on that.  You mentioned that, Mr. Chairman, in your brilliant summary.  Stock prices are questionable.  How much does it really affect, at least in a reasonable time frame, the median household.  And then, Betsy’s point, as I interpreted it, was a key point.  And that is, the transmission between MBS prices and what actually happens to the average household—and we think it will take time. I am always thinking at this table: I don’t work for the big banks; I don’t work for the dealers; I work for the average American household, and that is our job.  And the question is  efficacy. I think it is a little bit too early to judge an effect. Besides that, as we know, despite contradictory data that Governor Yellen presented from Zillow, and so on, the housing market actually took off before we launched QE3.  We were not quite sure, but that has been confirmed by the data now.  We have to be very careful and take our time to understand what the real effect of what we have done is, in addition to what we see in terms of immediate financial indexes.  That is my point. With regard to the options that have been presented to us, although I was not supportive of QE3—and I still think it is to be determined whether it is successful—I would support alternative B. I appreciate some of the language tweaking that took place in the first paragraph to indicate a little peppier consumer behavior.  I had suggested that in a memo. I’m grateful that you took it, and I consider it certainly less worse than alternative A.  And because we are already going down that path, it is the most likely option to adopt, and, even though my heart tells me that alternative C is closer to my thinking, I would support alternative B.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing agreement with the points made by others at the table and expressing their own thoughts on the topic.


Passage number 153.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support option B.  Minimizing changes to the statement until we get more visibility into fiscal policy and the effect of our earlier actions seems appropriate. At our next meeting, I would ideally like to adopt thresholds for actions based on economic outcomes and to build a consensus around beginning Treasury purchases when the MEP ends.  Reducing our gross purchases at the start of 2013 risks a noticeable reversal in the configuration of asset prices that our initial announcement set in train.  To me, that seems   premature and would further risk an undesirable return to the weak recovery that we have experienced to date. The Tealbook assumes that we will stop purchases next June with the unemployment rate at 7.9 percent, nonfarm payroll growing in the first half of 2013 at the same pace as the second half of this year, and the PCE inflation rate below 2 percent.  The optics, if not the economics, of stopping under such circumstances seems troublesome.  Our statement is clear in suggesting we will continue purchases until we see substantial improvement in labor markets.  I do not view substantial improvement as consistent with an unemployment rate 0.1 percentage point higher than it was in September. My own threshold for discussing the end of an $85 billion purchase program for Treasury and MBS securities would be 7¼ percent, assuming that inflation and inflation expectations remained well behaved. At that point, the discussion should center on whether overall labor market conditions were consistent with substantial improvement.  For example, whether the lower unemployment rate reflected job creation rather than reductions in the labor force; whether we had seen sustained, robust payroll employment growth; and whether we envision continued substantial improvement in labor markets for some quarters to come.  Under those conditions, I would stop asset purchases and stop reinvesting. My threshold for beginning the discussion about raising the federal funds rate would be an unemployment rate of 6½ percent—again, assuming that inflation and inflation expectations remain well behaved.  Whether the threshold became a trigger would, again, be determined by whether the lower unemployment rate reflected a real improvement in labor markets and the likelihood that it would continue on.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Rosengren, is expressing his support for Option B and offering his opinion on the timing of asset purchases and the conditions for raising the federal funds rate.


Passage number 154.
  MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Governors may not have been fully briefed on the Conference of Presidents meeting we had in Los Angeles, where we had a presentation on the American Western.  I am going to channel my inner Gary Cooper this morning.  [Laughter] I support alternative B. Actually, just one comment on the language.  In paragraph 1, I would be happy with just saying, “Conditions in the housing sector have continued to improve,” dropping the phrase “albeit from a depressed level.” I think the housing sector conditions have evolved enough over the recent months to break with the earlier qualifying statement. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thanks, Jimmy.  [Laughter] President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their support for alternative B and suggesting a minor change to the language in paragraph 1, but there is no argument or disagreement mentioned.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 155.
 MR. LACKER.  I will spare you my John Wayne.  [Laughter] I cannot support additional asset purchases at this time.  Further stimulus, I think, is unlikely to result in a discernible improvement in economic growth.  And I think if it does, it will cause an unwanted increase in inflation. Economic activity has been growing at a modest pace on average. Inflation has been fluctuating around 2 percent.  Unemployment does remain high by historical standards, but the improvement in the labor market appears to have been held back by real impediments beyond the capacity of monetary policy to offset.  In such circumstances, I think further monetary stimulus runs the risk of raising inflation and destabilizing inflation expectations.  Moreover, I think further expansion of our balance sheet would make our exit strategy riskier and more challenging. The proposed statement says, “The Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.”  I read this as saying that we will keep the funds rate near zero for a considerable time after we see a marked increase in the growth of employment and output.  I don’t think a policy conforming to this characterization would be appropriate because it implies providing too much stimulus, beyond the point at which I think we are going to need to begin raising rates. Finally, I remain opposed to purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities.  Because we’re doing imitations, I am tempted to channel the “Most Interesting Man in the World” and say I don’t often support purchasing assets, but when I do, I prefer purchasing Treasuries.  [Laughter] As we discussed last time, and as the staff analysis documented, purchasing MBS can be expected to reduce borrowing rates for conforming mortgages by more than it reduces borrowing rates for nonconforming mortgages or for other borrowing sectors, such as small business, autos, or unsecured consumer loans. I haven’t seen any convincing analysis of why such a credit reallocation would be preferable, relative to our objectives.  Moreover, deliberately tilting the flow of credit to one particular economic sector is, in my view, an inappropriate role for the Federal Reserve.  And I will, again, cite the joint statement of the Department of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve on March 23, 2009, which says, “Government decisions to influence the allocation of credit are the province of the fiscal authorities.”  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in this passage. Mr. Lacker opposes additional asset purchases and believes further stimulus would not improve economic growth and could lead to increased inflation. He also opposes purchasing agency mortgage-backed securities and argues that deliberately tilting credit flow to a specific sector is not the role of the Federal Reserve. President Williams may have a different viewpoint on these issues but it is not stated in this passage.


Passage number 156.
 MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  Despite the recent uptick in the data, the pace of economic recovery remains modest.  Inflation continues to be subdued, and inflation expectations are well anchored.  The current stance of policy is providing essential stimulus and remains entirely appropriate.  That said, to continue the comments that President Rosengren made, I expect it will be some time before the outlook for the labor market improves substantially.  Therefore, we will need to continue our purchases of longer-term Treasury securities well past the end of the year, and longer-term MBS purchases as well.  So at our next meeting, we’ll need to signal this expectation along the lines of alternative A, although when I look at alternative A, I favor continuing with something like the substantial improvement in labor market language. And finally, there was some comment earlier about our needing to improve our communication, and my own reading of the market view on what our purchases will be is entirely consistent with our policy statement.  So I think it’s actually the staff reading of what our statement said that was probably more conservative in terms of alternative B. I don’t think the communication toward the public was at fault there.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their support for alternative B and providing their reasoning for their position.


Passage number 157.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  You know, someday I think people are going to go through the transcript and have a case study on the effectiveness of advertising, because it’s interesting that President Lacker can make an allusion to a product and nobody would ask what that product was.  That’s effective advertising, I guess.  [Laughter] At any rate, I support alternative B.  I support continuing our $85 billion per month of purchases of long-duration assets. Yesterday we seemed to agree that state-contingent policies are appropriate.  We disagreed over whether they should be qualitative or quantitative.  So because our statement undertakes qualitative guidance, let me offer my own interpretation of what alternative B is saying.  Apparently that is different from the assumption of the staff analysis.  I think the staff does as well as they can with the modest direction that the Committee gives them, so there’s no fault intended there.I think substantial improvement in the labor market outlook ought to be associated with growth in payroll employment on the order of 200,000 per month for a period of, say, four to six months, some substantial period.  I think it should be associated with GDP growth above trend for almost two quarters, to align with the fact that economic growth is supporting that substantial improvement in the labor market, so that it’s not just a head fake.  I think we would see clear downward momentum in the unemployment rate if we were seeing that type of substantial improvement, and I think that all the other associated labor market indicators ought to show similar improvement. I don’t have any disagreements with the way President Rosengren described that we should be seeing the unemployment rate perhaps down as low as 7¼ percent to make a decision on ending purchases and a lower unemployment rate for liftoff. I think that’s more like the dealer survey results as I saw them.  So I agree with President Williams.  I think we’re doing a pretty good job with communicating there, and I think that some additional commentary from you, Mr. Chairman, will help there. Now, “in a context of price stability,” is an important thing to also offer clarity on.  Here, given that it’s a qualitative type of description, I would say that must be associated with something like underlying inflation that remains below an acceptable upper tolerance with respect to our longer-run inflation objective, which I would take to be about ½ percentage point above 2 percent.  So my preference is to educate the public regarding our intention of what we mean by substantial improvement.  I think thresholds would be a lot cleaner and easier to describe, but that seems to be where we are.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their support for alternative B and providing their own interpretation of what it means. They also agree with President Rosengren and President Williams.


Passage number 158.
MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I support alternative B for today, and I have one suggestion for a change in the language based on President Kocherlakota’s earlier comment concerning the last sentence of paragraph 2, which reads, “The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely would run at or below its 2 percent objective.” I see that, based on his comment, as a little bit inconsistent with what we think now, because we did take the aggressive easing action at the last meeting, and we do think that that’s supposed to keep inflation a little bit higher.  So maybe instead of “at or below,” how about “near”—“would run near its 2 percent objective”.  And that would suggest that the Committee feels like it has responded to this as opposed to just saying that we’re going to accept the lower inflation that would otherwise be projected.  So instead of “at or below” it would be “near.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 159.
” MR. ENGLISH.  Sorry, could I just make a comment. I think the Chairman was correct earlier, that that sentence was intended to be conditional on “without sufficient policy accommodation.”  So the earlier sentence on economic growth and labor market conditions said “without sufficient policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate,” and then the last sentence says, “The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely would run at or below its 2 percent objective,” again, if there were not sufficient policy accommodation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. English is simply offering a comment and agreeing with the Chairman's earlier statement about the conditional nature of the sentence.


Passage number 160.
 MR. BULLARD.  But we do have sufficient accommodation, or we think we do.  We’re trying to adopt a policy that’s addressing this.  So I just think it’s confusing.  I took it that the first part was to say, well, if we hadn’t taken action, we’d be in trouble, but now that we have taken action, we’re getting close.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Bullard is expressing his opinion and thoughts about the current situation.


Passage number 161.
 MR. ENGLISH.  I think the “sufficient” is supposed to pick up how long do the purchases continue. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We have, in effect, not made any commitments beyond December.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. English is simply providing his interpretation and understanding of the situation without contradicting or arguing with anyone else.


Passage number 162.
 MR. BULLARD.  Well, that’s my suggestion, “near.” CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Bullard is simply giving his suggestion and expressing gratitude for the opportunity to do so.


Passage number 163.
 MR. LACKER.  Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage consists of a simple greeting by Mr. Lacker to the Chairman and President of an unknown organization.


Passage number 164.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you.  I appreciate that very careful exposition of this issue and identifying it as connected with this phrase in the statement about “considerable time” afterward.  My understanding of the effectiveness of the Woodford period is that it depends critically on the elevation of expected inflation above what your rule would normally have been committing you to.  So you have to temporarily raise expected inflation for a time in order for that Woodford period to have some effectiveness on real activity. I just want to confirm that understanding and then make a comment about it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There does not appear to be any contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their appreciation for the explanation and seeking confirmation of their understanding before making a comment.


Passage number 165.
 MR. BULLARD.  That’s definitely my understanding.  What I would like is to get some clarity—maybe in my own head and, to some extent, maybe around the table—about what we’re trying to do.  And then you can argue about other things:  Whether, for instance, you really are constrained in the first part, because you’ve got QE—that’s my position—or about the price level path.  So the kinds of things that are talked about in Woodford haven’t really materialized.  The theory could be wrong for many other reasons.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is expressing their understanding and seeking clarity about what they are trying to do, and suggesting that further discussion can focus on other topics such as QE or price level path. They mention that the theories discussed in Woodford have not materialized, but this does not indicate disagreement or contention.


Passage number 166.
  But if that’s what we’re trying to do, I just wanted to get the— MR. LACKER.  Right.  I just wanted to follow up.  We had a long discussion a year or so ago and had a lot of staff analysis about the prospect of deliberately raising expected inflation; we decided not to go down that path.  I’d also point out, Mr. Chairman, that my understanding of your communications after the meeting is that you’ve been clear that we don’t intend to raise inflation above 2 percent.  So there’s a tension in our communications between interpreting this as kind of a Woodfordian extension of our zero-lower-bound period and the notion that we’re not admitting that we want to raise inflation. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No, I don’t think there’s any meaningful contradiction.  The way I interpret what we’re trying to do is that in the Tealbook, there’s an optimal control path for the federal funds rate, which is the path you would take if you could perfectly commit today all the way out to the future. I think what we’re trying to do is, in some sense, convince the public we’re going to take that optimal control path. It’s a time-inconsistent path, mildly, because it does go a little bit further out than the estimated reaction function goes, but (a) it’s not working through a deliberate increase in expected inflation, and (b) as it happens, the projected inflation under that path is like .2 percent.  So there is no meaningful increase in inflation under that path because the Phillips curve is so flat. Now, as a matter of principle, it is saying that we are taking a balanced approach.  We’re not trying to change our target and we’re not trying to change inflation expectations in the long term.  But a small amount of inflation—2.2 percent—is a side effect of getting better overall results and is within the range of the optimal control path.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no disagreement or contention in this passage. The speaker is providing an explanation to address a potential tension raised by another person, but they do not express any disagreement or contradiction in their response.


Passage number 167.
 MR. BULLARD.  So, Mr. Chairman, I just want to follow up on that. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not present any contention or disagreement as it simply states that Mr. Bullard wants to follow up on something without indicating any opposition or conflicting views.


Passage number 168.
 MR. BULLARD. I agree, of course you’d like to get to the optimal control path, but I don’t think commitment is going to be very effective just with words.  What I’m trying to point out is that as your favorite policy rule starts to project liftoff and you stay at zero, that’s a period where you actually can start to gain credibility and perhaps get closer to that optimal path. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Right, but that will help us in 2020.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. Both speakers seem to agree on the importance of gaining credibility and moving towards the optimal path for policy.


Passage number 169.
  It won’t help us in this— MR. BULLARD.  It depends on when you think you’re entering the Woodford period.  That’s the period when you should be able to start to gain some credibility, in my view. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. Mr. Bullard is offering his viewpoint, but there is no evidence of a disagreement or argument.


Passage number 170.
 MR. EVANS.  If I could just add to what you said, Mr. Chairman, in our Chicago DSGE model and in our Brookings paper, the funds rate continues to be zero for a very long period of time.  But it’s not necessarily the fact that inflation goes up; it’s really moving down the IS curve in our model.  So it’s going to depend on details of the economic situation. It does not have to lead to higher inflation, or certainly nothing very much in the period that could be referred to as the Woodford period.  It could be referred to as the Williams period, I’m told, as well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any explicit disagreement or contention. Mr. Evans is simply adding to the Chairman's statement and explaining the details of their model. There is no contradiction or argument presented in this passage.


Passage number 171.
MR. WILLIAMS.  Reifschneider–Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. This is because it only mentions the names "Reifschneider" and "Williams" without providing any context or indication of a disagreement or conflict.


Passage number 172.
 MR. EVANS.  Reifschneider–Williams, my apologies.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It is a statement of apology from Mr. Evans.


Passage number 173.
 MR. WILLIAMS.  We have our lawyers, who will contact your lawyers.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply states that the speaker's lawyers will contact the listener's lawyers.


Passage number 174.
  [Laughter] MR. EVANS.  This preceded Professor Woodford by how many years.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any statements, arguments, or contrasting opinions that could indicate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 175.
 MR. WILLIAMS.  We’ll let the lawyers work that out. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We will have the precedence discussions later.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "We'll let the lawyers work that out" implies willingness to delegate the decision to the lawyers, and the statement "We will have the precedence discussions later" suggests a plan to address the matter in the future. President Kocherlakota's response is not given, so it cannot be determined if there is any contention or disagreement from his side.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 176.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I was opposed to the new round of asset purchases we undertook last time.  My view on that really hasn’t changed.  I see the costs of the program as exceeding the benefits.  I think the nature of the program makes it particularly important that we think hard about our stopping rule for our open-ended purchases. I appreciate President Rosengren’s comments about how if we go to a threshold system about the funds rate, we have to be very careful not to necessarily have people infer that what we mean by substantial improvement in labor markets isn’t what we just told them in the thresholds. Distinguishing between what is the stopping rule for asset purchases as opposed to the funds rate guidance is going to be an important part of that communication, if we go with thresholds.  I think there is a lot that we need to talk about in terms of that, and I am worried that if we don’t get that communication right, we could have some very confused markets and bad outcomes. Part of the reason I have been concerned about the nature of forward guidance and the challenges we face is I am not convinced, as some people are, about the quantitative effectiveness of this forward guidance.  People seem to attribute movements in asset prices to be driving all of that, but I’m not sure that in terms of the real economy and the unemployment rate we have seen much benefit from that.  So I am concerned about the effectiveness of our forward-guidance tools.  Relying so much on that and relying on managing expectations, I think, is a very tricky game. Trying to signal, through a commitment that we may or may not be able to reach, that we are going to maintain low rates longer continues to make me concerned about the consequences that happen at the exit. I am very concerned that the built-up effects of keeping interest rates too low, too long, so to speak, could actually cause long-term rates to rise very rapidly at the point when the markets begin to get a whiff of the idea that it is time to change policies.  And we will have a long way to go to catch up to where, perhaps, standard policy might say it needs to be.  And if that happens—interest rate risks, the effects on bank balance sheets, the effects in the market, the difficulties of interest rate risk on our own portfolio, and our ability to raise rates fast enough without losses and turmoil in the marketplace—that could be quite traumatic and quite challenging for us and for the economy.  I hope not. So, given that I don’t think the effectiveness of that forward guidance is quantitatively as important as we seem to think it is, the risks on the upside are quite troubling to me.  And we are taking potentially very large risks to achieve what I think are dubious and meager gains on our dual mandate, if you will. I think it is very important at our next meeting, as we continue to discuss the threshold argument, to combine that with how we are going to think about stopping rules for asset purchases and how those are going to relate to one another. Okay.  I do have one comment.  I can live with alternative B, but I do want to go back to paragraph 2, because I think it is kind of confusing.  President Kocherlakota focused on the last sentence on inflation.  I actually think the confusing part of paragraph 2 is the second sentence:“The Committee remains concerned that, without sufficient policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions.” It seems to me we put that statement in last time to signal something about what the action was we were taking.  At this meeting, we are not taking an action.  I am concerned a bit that this sentence actually could be very much misinterpreted as saying that we don’t think we have sufficient accommodation in place at this time or won’t in the future.  Is the interpretation going to be that this is signaling that we will continue to do more accommodation come January, when we really haven’t made that decision yet. So I am a bit worried about that sentence.  I think it would be more straightforward to go back to a sentence that says something like, “The Committee outlook is for gradual improvement in labor market conditions.” I think tying it in this paragraph to policy is what makes this paragraph confusing.  The second paragraph, typically in the past, I think, has been a paragraph about our outlook for the key variables.  And this is sort of saying something about policy—we make the statement later on, I think it’s in paragraph 4, that we are prepared to take further action if we view our employment and price objectives at risk. So I think putting this statement in the second paragraph is actually the source of confusion here.  So my own modest suggestion is that we just change that second sentence, and then I think the paragraph hangs together better, and we still have the indication of policy in paragraph 4.  So that is my suggestion, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  What would you change it to, President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. Mr. Plosser expresses his disagreement with the new round of asset purchases and raises concerns about the effectiveness of forward guidance and the potential risks of keeping interest rates low for too long. He also suggests changing a sentence in the second paragraph to make it less confusing and more aligned with the Committee's outlook.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 177.
 MR. PLOSSER. Because this is mostly about outlooks in paragraph 2, I think you could just change the second sentence to say, just like we’ve said before, “The Committee’s outlook is   for gradual improvement in labor market conditions.”  And not make some reference to whether the level of policy accommodation is sufficient or not sufficient at this point.  You make that reference down later when we talk about policy actions and the prospects for future policy.  That’s just my suggestion. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Yellen. MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B. I take President Fisher’s point that we should not prematurely pat ourselves on the back, but overall I think our actions did elicit the financial market responses we expected, and that does serve to raise my confidence that our asset program will be efficacious over time, especially in providing support to the housing market.  For today, I am happy with the statement language as it stands. As I discussed during the economic go-round, despite some encouraging signals from the household sector and the recent decline in the unemployment rate, I have seen no evidence of any substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market or any fundamental strengthening in economic conditions.  And I would agree with Presidents Williams, Evans, and Rosengren on what substantial improvement in the outlook means.  It seems to me that the dealers’ expectations, their interpretation that we see in the dealer survey of what that means is quite reasonable and coincides with my own. With a step-up in fiscal restraint expected at the beginning of next year, uncertainty about the resolution of the fiscal cliff and debt ceiling likely to escalate as we approach year-end, and the European debt crisis continuing to weigh on the economy, I would be surprised to see much, if any, further improvement in the labor market over the next few months.  So I expect that at our December meeting, it will prove appropriate to extend our longer-term Treasury purchases  beyond the completion of the MEP, and this expectation is now obviously prevalent in the markets. I think that the changes we have made to our forward guidance have been quite well received.  Market participants now expect the first tightening to occur in the second half of 2015, only after the unemployment rate has declined to around 6.8 percent.  This is a downward shift of almost half a percentage point since March in market expectations concerning the likely unemployment rate at liftoff, and I think these expectations do reflect some element of understanding in the market that we do intend to be lower for longer or to provide somewhat more accommodation than a typical policy rule would call for. Given the close alignment between market and Committee expectations concerning liftoff, the adoption of thresholds, as we have discussed yesterday and today, probably would not entail meaningful additional accommodation.  But even so, I really think that adopting quantitative thresholds to further clarify our forward guidance would enhance its effectiveness, not just right now but particularly over the next several years, as the recovery proceeds and attention in the markets begins to focus more intensively on the likely timing of tightening. For all the reasons we discussed yesterday, and that President Kocherlakota has emphasized this morning, I think it is a good idea to include quantitative threshold language in our December statement.  And I think President Kocherlakota this morning made some very constructive suggestions about how we might craft language to go about doing that. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Duke. MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B, and the notes I brought into the meeting say that I said pretty much everything I had to say in the earlier round and have nothing further to add.  But that’s not strictly true.  [Laughter] I am going to stay out of the discussions of the Woodford period, or, given my loyalties, the Williams–Reifschneider period, and focus on the condition that I think is most important in the statement, which is in the last sentence of paragraph 4, and that is efficacy. In judging the efficacy of policy, I will be watching the primary mortgage rate and its effect on home purchases and home prices.  And my point yesterday was that I think we are going to need to be patient in making that judgment.  President Fisher pointed out that house prices actually took off before QE3, but that is exactly my point.  I think that was the first result of earlier reductions in the mortgage rate, and it was watching those initial signs work their way through to actual increases in house prices and, I think, consumer confidence, that leads me to believe that we are going to, again, have to be really patient and watch this.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in this passage. Governor Plosser suggests changing the statement to remove reference to the level of policy accommodation, while Governor Yellen expresses support for the current statement language and discusses the need for continued policy accommodation.


Passage number 178.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  This morning has a bit of the feel of the NFL preseason, where some teams try out the whole playbook to see how the defense is going to react, and others are a little bit more cautious, and still others are trying to figure out what kind of offense they can run with the personnel they’ve got on the field.  Being a fan of the New England Patriots, I am going to take the Bill Belichick approach.  So let me say I support alternative B, and we will see you on opening day.  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Raskin. MS. RASKIN.  I support alternative B.  The additional accommodation that we put in place last month still seems appropriate to me.  The recent improvements in the household sector notwithstanding, we are a long way from maximum employment.  Payrolls continue to rise onlygradually, and I think it will be some time before we see considerable momentum in the labor market. At the same time, inflation appears to be well contained.  Core inflation, which seems the most relevant measure right now as food and energy prices swing, looks like it is about 1¼ percent in the second half of this year.  So, if anything, inflation may be on the low side.  And survey measures of inflation expectations have ticked down.  In addition, in my view, the primary risks to the outlook are still large and to the downside.  For all of these reasons, I support keeping in place the accommodation that we agreed on in September. In particular, our new “lower for longer” language begins to clarify for economic agents our commitment to better outcomes, more in line with our mandate.  With this forward guidance, the lower tail of possibilities that households and businesses might worry about gets cut off.  For instance, the odds that this Committee begins to tighten at the first sign of good labor market news and prematurely slows the economy now seem reduced.  Similarly, the chance that this Committee will greet worsening economic data with a shrug and a “we’ve done all we can” probably seems less likely to economic participants. In September, we not only changed our forward-guidance language, we also backed up that strong language with flow-based large-scale asset purchases.  In my view, this combination of clearer forward guidance and asset purchases may currently be having a beneficial effect, not only on interest rates but also on public expectations of where the economy is headed.  I continue to believe that there is a strong argument to be made for being even more explicit with our forward guidance. In particular, I think now would be an excellent time to introduce quantitative thresholds in the context of qualitative guardrails, as a refinement of the work that we did in the September meeting. We have taken the first step in clarifying our policy, and market participants seem to have understood it pretty well.  However, the longer we wait to adopt explicit thresholds, the higher the likelihood that our message will become muddled. If we decline to clarify our thresholds, markets and the public will be confused about what they are, and speculation likely will fill that vacuum.  Bloggers and editorial writers, and maybe even individuals at this table making speeches, will likely start to offer opinions about what those thresholds are and should be.  It seems to me that by allowing others, rather than the Committee as a collective whole, to frame that discussion, we are shirking our responsibility to communicate clearly and to help shape expectations. As argued so well this morning by President Kocherlakota, confusion about our thresholds could also affect inflation expectations.  If outsiders begin to believe that we have a lower inflation threshold than we do, when inflation moves above that level, there might be some concern that we have lost our resolve or our ability to keep inflation in check, thereby raising inflation expectations. Thus I am ready to implement thresholds because I think they will enhance the clarity of the policy moves we made last time. I also think that as we continue to wrestle with the effectiveness of large-scale asset purchases, the need to focus on refining our forward guidance becomes increasingly more pressing.  That said, I am content to support alternative B at this time. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Stein.

Passage number 179.
 MR. STEIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  So we have heard from Gary Cooper and Bill Belichick. I guess it is to me to play the role of Woody Allen and go on at some length about my personal neuroses.  [Laughter]   I support alternative B, but I do want to say a few words in looking forward to December about alternative A because, obviously, we are going to have to start thinking about pace, composition, and duration of asset purchases.  So I am not going to try and advocate anything at this point, but I do want to lay out a few of the issues.  One way to frame the problem that we face is that as long as we are falling short on the employment leg of our mandate, and as long as inflation is contained, we want to maximize the stimulus we can provide, but subject to two constraints.  One is not overly degrading market functioning in either the Treasury or the MBS market, and the other is some kind of limit on total balance sheet size to the extent that we think that a larger balance sheet is associated with some form of cost, be it in the form of either expected losses on our positions, strains in money markets, or a more challenging exit. To make an example, you might say, “Well, we’re willing to do something like $500 billion more in total,” and then the problem becomes one of, do we want to do it at an $80 billion pace for 6 months or at a slower pace, say, $40 billion for as long as 12 months. If you pose the problem this way, would there ever be a reason not to go out of the gate fast.  That is to say, would there ever be a reason to not go out at the $85 billion pace, understanding that all else equal, there is a shadow cost of the balance sheet that would constrain you to do things for a shorter period of time. So my thinking is that, in a world where Treasury and MBS purchases are relatively close substitutes, and where all that really matters is the amount of duration that you are taking out of the market, the two options should be roughly similar.  And I would think, in fact, there is a small presumption in favor of the higher initial flow rate because, all else equal, you are getting the purchases done sooner, so the total amount of stimulus is a bit greater.  That feels to me like the classical argument that you would make here.   I think if you want to take the other side, a necessary condition is you are going to have to argue that Treasury and MBS purchases are not perfect substitutes.  And we have heard a little bit about that in the last couple of days.  So, for example, if you think that MBS purchases are more helpful to the economy because there is more potential to stimulate stuff related to housing, then in the presence of some kind of shadow balance sheet constraint, you might have an argument to go slower because, all else equal, if you go slower you can continue the MBS purchase piece of it longer.  You will have more head room to do the MBS purchase piece.  So I suspect there is a case to be made here, and I have alluded to it, others have alluded to it.  I don’t want to say it is an empirically validated case, but I think it is something worth trying to get a more precise handle on. Another dimension on which Treasuries and MBS differ is exit, and this has also been alluded to; Governor Duke mentioned this.  If we are getting into a zone where we think the sheer size of the balance sheet may complicate the process of exit, I suppose you could argue that that is an advantage of MBS, to the extent that they have a shorter duration and tend to run off on their own without having to be sold.  On the other hand, if we’re determined, as in the exit principles, to actually get rid of the MBS before they run off by selling, I think that complicates things, because I think it is quite possible that liquidity in the MBS market will have been compromised by the fact that we will have occupied such a large space in this market. A final point, just to flag, is that in December—this has come up before—we are going to have to really wrestle with the potential divergence that has been pointed out between market expectations for the path of policy and our own admittedly heterogeneous views about the cost of expanding the balance sheet.  As has been noted, the market very clearly expects us to come out of the gate at an $85 billion flow, so I think there is going to be a natural temptation to want to   deliver that so as to not disappoint the market.  But, of course, the market also expects—and I think it is an expectation that is a reasonable one, given what we have said—this program to go on until early 2014, which implies a balance sheet somewhere north of $4 trillion. So if there are broadly felt misgivings about that prospect, I do think it is important that we confront them in December as opposed to kind of just going with the flow and dealing with that problem later.  And this is very inherently a dynamic problem.  If there are constraints of this sort, I think they have to be factored into the whole path of the policy rather than pushed off into the future.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Powell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 180.
 MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  So we have had Gary Cooper, the Most Interesting Man in the World, Bill Belichick, Woody Allen, and now Hamlet.  [Laughter] I support alternative B, to relieve the suspense.  And as far as what is to be decided at the next meeting, it seems to me we should let it be decided at the next meeting.  But I will say that if we have another good run of data, I think there would be a strong case to defer action.  And I don’t see us as committed to act unless conditions warrant. I have concerns about more purchases.  As others have pointed out, the dealer community is now assuming close to a $4 trillion balance sheet and purchases through the first quarter of 2014. I admit that is a much stronger reaction than I anticipated, and I am uncomfortable with it for a couple of reasons. First, the question, why stop at $4 trillion.  The market in most cases will cheer us for doing more.  It will never be enough for the market.  Our models will always tell us that we are helping the economy, and I will probably always feel that those benefits are overestimated.  And we will be able to tell ourselves that market function is not impaired and that inflationexpectations are under control.  What is to stop us, other than much faster economic growth, which it is probably not in our power to produce. Second, I think we are actually at a point of encouraging risk-taking, and that should give us pause.  Investors really do understand now that we will be there to prevent serious losses.  It is not that it is easy for them to make money but that they have every incentive to take more risk, and they are doing so.  Meanwhile, we look like we are blowing a fixed-income duration bubble right across the credit spectrum that will result in big losses when rates come up down the road.  You can almost say that that is our strategy. My third concern—and others have touched on it as well—is the problems of exiting from a near $4 trillion balance sheet.  We’ve got a set of principles from June 2011 and have done some work since then, but it just seems to me that we seem to be way too confident that exit can be managed smoothly.  Markets can be much more dynamic than we appear to think. Take selling—we are talking about selling all of these mortgage-backed securities.  Right now, we are buying the market, effectively, and private capital will begin to leave that activity and find something else to do.  So when it is time for us to sell, or even to stop buying, the response could be quite strong; there is every reason to expect a strong response.  So there are a couple of ways to look at it.  It is about $1.2 trillion in sales; you take 60 months, you get about $20 billion a month.  That is a very doable thing, it sounds like, in a market where the norm by the middle of next year is $80 billion a month.  Another way to look at it, though, is that it’s not so much the sale, the duration; it’s also unloading our short volatility position.  When you turn and say to the market, “I’ve got $1.2 trillion of these things,” it’s not just $20 billion a month— it’s the sight of the whole thing coming.  And I think there is a pretty good chance that you could   have quite a dynamic response in the market.  And I would just say I want to understand that a lot better in the intermeeting period and leave it at that.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is mainly a statement of the speaker's concerns and opinions.


Passage number 181.
 MR. LOCKHART.  It’s not a burning issue. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes, I know.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not contain any clear indication of contention or disagreement. Mr. Lockhart acknowledges that "it's not a burning issue" and there is no conflicting opinion presented.


Passage number 182.
 MR. LOCKHART. It’s just that we’ve continued to state that meeting after meeting after meeting.  And in the meantime the housing sector has evolved, and at some stage we should bring it up to current, it seems to me.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not show any direct contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing an observation about the housing sector and suggesting that it should be brought up to current.


Passage number 183.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. It’s accurate; it’s showing further signs of improvement. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. It does say that things are getting better, meeting to meeting.  So it does have that sense.  Okay.  I thought hard about President Plosser’s concern about the second sentence in paragraph 2.  If others have a view, you should say it.  I think we’reprotected there.  I think it’s clear, but if we’re not, we’re protected by paragraph 3, which is quite explicit about what we’re actually going to do.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It is expressing agreement and assurance.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 184.
  So I don’t think there’s any inference taken that we’ve changed our policy, but I’m happy to— MR. EVANS.  What’s the suggestion then. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser was concerned about the second sentence in paragraph 2, concerned that that somehow suggested that we were going to take additional action beyond what we proposed in September.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. President Plosser expresses concern about the language in paragraph 2, suggesting that there may be a disagreement or disagreement between him and the speaker about the potential for additional action beyond what was proposed in September.


Passage number 185.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Excuse me.  Or perhaps it might be inferred that we don’t believe sufficient policy accommodation is currently in place. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Again, we don’t, if we take what’s in place.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is contention or disagreement in the passage. 

Explanation: The phrase "Or perhaps it might be inferred that we don't believe sufficient policy accommodation is currently in place" indicates a potential disagreement or contention about the adequacy of the current policy accommodation. It suggests that there may be differing opinions about whether the current policy is sufficient.


Passage number 186.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Well, we may not in the future.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not contain any indication of contention or disagreement. It simply states a potential outcome in the future.


Passage number 187.
 Is it saying something— MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The mention of "Mr. Fisher" and "Mr. Chairman" does not indicate any contradictory or conflicting statements.


Passage number 188.
 MR. FISHER.  May I make a suggestion.  I think it would convey what it appears the majority of the Committee feels just by saying “The Committee remains concerned that economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor conditions,” or “The Committee remains concerned about the economy’s ability to generate sustained improvement in the labor market conditions.”  That’s really what we’re saying.  Why do we have to include “sufficient policy accommodation”. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, because we’re saying that if we do sufficient policy accommodation, we hope to get a better result.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a suggestion made by Mr. Fisher to revise the wording of a statement.


Passage number 189.
 MR. FISHER.  As you just said, we don’t know what we’re going to do in the future; you just said that in your summary.  We’re still conveying the same point:  That’s our concern.  Our  concern is whether we have sufficient economic growth to generate improvement in labor conditions.  I think that’s the point Mr. Plosser is making. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage shows agreement between Mr. Fisher and Mr. Plosser on the concern regarding economic growth and labor conditions. President Bullard's response is not included in the given passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 190.
 MR. BULLARD.  Yes.  I think this second sentence could be counterproductive.  You want to say that we’ve embarked on a path that we have confidence in and that is going to have the desired effects.  So I’m a little worried about that, but I’m happy to go with what you think.  But I think it could be construed as counterproductive.  What’s helping us here is that it’s not a big change from the last meeting, so people could say that we just left that in there. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Right.  President Fisher, I think your suggestion might actually say that even after what we said last September, we remain concerned.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in this passage between Mr. Bullard and President Fisher about the wording of a sentence and whether it could be counterproductive. Mr. Bullard expresses concern about the sentence, while President Fisher suggests that it could emphasize ongoing concern.


Passage number 191.
 MR. FISHER.  We are, we are. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage provided only contains a statement by Mr. Fisher saying "We are, we are." There is no indication of any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 192.
 I know, but it falls into the trap that President Plosser is concerned about, that it might be saying that we want to do even more than we suggested we might do in September, and I don’t think we want to communicate— MR. FISHER.  Well, I’m not going to fall on my sword over that one.  I don’t think it’s a big deal.  I like Dennis’s point, though, just taking out “albeit from a depressed level.” PARTICIPANTS.  But it is depressed. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The participants seem to agree that they don't want to communicate that they want to do more than they suggested in September. There is a small discussion about a specific phrase, but it doesn't seem to cause any major disagreement.


Passage number 193.
 MR. FISHER.  We’ve been saying it repeatedly.  It is true, but it is still continuing to improve, period. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply affirms a statement and adds that the situation is continuing to get better.


Passage number 194.
 MR. EVANS.  The thing about paragraph 2 is, it starts off by referring to our statutory mandate, so it’s about policy.  I think it’s entirely appropriate to have some kind of policyconditioning in there.  And then the other thing is it sets up paragraph 3 so well, and that seems to be the intent—“To support a stronger economic recovery”—and we think this is going to have a positive effect.  That’s what we’re trying to achieve.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The speaker, Mr. Evans, expresses his opinion about the use of policy conditioning in paragraph 2 and the positive effect it will have in supporting economic recovery.


Passage number 195.
  So I thought that was— MR. FISHER. I’m just trying to help with two suggestions, but if it’s not helpful, I’ll drop it. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Fisher, offers two suggestions but is willing to drop them if they are not helpful. President Lockhart's response is not confrontational or argumentative.


Passage number 196.
 MR. LOCKHART. I have to say I’m a little confused, maybe, about the debate around paragraph 2, but my simple reading of it is that we’re kind of repeating what we said last time, but we’re continuing to express the concerns about sustaining policy accommodation.  So if you substitute the phrase “without sustained and sufficient policy accommodation” or “without sustained policy accommodation,” I think the rest of the paragraph continues to work. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That’s fine with me.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing confusion but agrees with the suggested substitutions for the phrase in paragraph 2.


Passage number 197.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  What’s the suggestion. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Change “sufficient” to “sustained.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any suggestion or disagreement as it simply states what change is being proposed, without expressing any opinion or debate.


Passage number 198.
” MR. STEIN.  “Sustained” would seem to hint that you’re going to do more purchases of Treasuries.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 199.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. I think it might be a little too forward leaning.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply expresses a personal opinion about something.


Passage number 200.
 MR. STEIN.  It might be forward leaning, yes. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  All right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Stein is simply agreeing that something might be forward leaning.


Passage number 201.
  May I— MR. FISHER.  It’s less Gary Cooper–ish.  Leave it the way it— CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. In the interest of efficiency, may I ask that we stay with where we are. PARTICIPANTS. Yes.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  So let’s go ahead and vote on alternative B as written.  Thank you. MS. DANKER.  This vote is on alternative B and the associated directive. Chairman Bernanke Yes Vice Chairman Dudley Yes Governor Duke Yes President Lacker No President Lockhart Yes President Pianalto Yes Governor Powell Yes Governor Raskin Yes Governor Stein Yes Governor Tarullo Yes President Williams Yes Governor Yellen Yes CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  Why don’t we take 15 minutes for coffee, and then we’ll take the last item. [Coffee break] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Why don’t we reconvene. We’re on the final item, item 5, “Experimental Consensus Forecast.”  This is something we’ve been talking about for a few meetings.  The Summary of Economic Projections does a great job of showing the diversity of views, but I think the Committee felt there was a need to show a more coherent representation of the consensus perspective of the Committee, both to explain our policy decisions and to give the public a chance to better identify our reaction functions.  Also there was some hope that we could build this into a regular reporting, like a quarterly monetary policy report.  So in that spirit, we have undertaken a couple of exercises to try to see how it might work. I think we learned a great deal from those exercises, and what we want to do today is discuss whether we want to continue the experiment and, if so, in what direction.  So we have a brief presentation of yet another very good staff memo, and Jeremy Rudd will lead the discussion.  Jeremy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The participants all agree to stay with the current alternative B and there is no mention of any disagreement or opposition.


Passage number 202.
 MR. TARULLO.  Mr. Chairman.  Could I just ask Janet to clarify, because I started taking notes too late.  Janet, if we look at the questions for discussion that the staff passed out, I  think you addressed each of these, but I was just trying to figure out whether you did, in fact.  This would be the sub-questions under number 2.  I think, if I understood correctly, you’re for A. MS. YELLEN.  I’m for A.  I’m for B, possibly C, and possibly D.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Tarullo is simply seeking clarification from Janet and confirming her stance on the different sub-questions.


Passage number 203.
 MR. TARULLO.  D possible, but think about it. MS. YELLEN.  Yes, but we have to decide how to go about doing that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both Mr. Tarullo and Ms. Yellen seem to be open to the idea of something being possible, but they are discussing the process of deciding how to approach it.


Passage number 204.
 MR. TARULLO. Right. E—you said to think hard, right. MS. YELLEN.  Yes, I’m a little bit worried about that.  F, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing agreement and concern.


Passage number 205.
 MR. TARULLO.  F, yes.  Okay.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Let me turn to President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 206.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I agree with Governor Yellen that a modification to the SEP is probably the best course to follow.  I just offer the following thoughts very quickly.  I think in any communications exercise designed to look beyond the near term, it makes little sense to exclude the views of those presidents not currently voting.  They will be voting, and we change the composition of the voters as we go through time.  So that would be point number one.  Point number two is, I would argue against excluding the views of any dissenters because the views of today’s dissenters, thoughtfully argued, may well influence the decisions of the Committee going forward.  So that’s a general comment. I’m in favor of modifying the SEP, but in terms of what we publish, I don’t think it should exclude some participants.  It should not just be members only.  With the specifics, I’m just going to address some very, very quickly.  I think the best way to modify the SEP, probably, is to publish the median projection of all participants.  After all, medians are insensitive to extreme views.  The tightness of the range—which I expect will be fairly tight—of the central tendency around the median is a measure of the degree of consensus among the Committee.  The   median projection of the funds rate could be plotted if you wanted to go this far, along with the paths prescribed by a fitted outcome-based rule or other simple rules to reveal whether participants believe a departure from business as usual is warranted.  This would tell whether views can be well approximated by a simple alternative rule.  That may be too radical a proposal.  My point is that I think publishing a central tendency is probably the best way to approach this, and I would include all participants. With regard to specific questions, I’ll comment on just a couple that Janet mentioned.  I’m not sure that publishing a scatter plot accomplishes a great deal, because the decision to raise the funds rate may depend on variables other than the current unemployment rate and inflation over the past year, as we’ve discussed around this table.  For example, it may depend on the change in the unemployment rate or, if we wanted to go as far as what my staff has been advocating, a nominal income gap.  So that’s the point that I want to make there. From the standpoint of individual attributions, I have sort of mixed feelings about this.  One of the things I’m concerned about if we were to do this publicly is that participants might become less willing to modify their views in response to new information or arguments of their colleagues and more intent on defending their views.  And they may pull their punches a little bit.  As a consequence, they may be a little bit reluctant to share their true opinions when they provide their input. Then the question Janet raised, I also have a question about, which is whether we would publish internally our individual SEP submissions. I’ve noticed in our discussions of the SEP that they sort of come forward, but what I would worry about here—and, again, this is my own phobia—is that certain names might be leaked over time, and then we would just sort of add to the possibility that that would occur.  So I have a question mark about that, Janet, as to whether we should—if we’re not going to release them publicly—actually release them internally.  Although, you know, you can usually tell where people stand, and often people—I do— volunteer that information. Mr. Chairman, as you know, I have to leave a little bit early, and I apologize for being so concise, though I’m sure people welcome my being concise.  Thank you very much. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 207.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I put together these comments looking out my second-floor view of the new Chicago Speaker’s Corner, with all of the people out there complaining about everything.  [Laughter] At any rate, the consensus forecasting exercise certainly has turned out to be an eye opener.  I didn’t think it was going to be this hard.  The staff memo does a very good job in describing the range of issues we have had to confront and the difficult decisions that we would have to make to produce such a consensus projection.  As always, thanks for all of the hard work; it was really well done. Rather than discuss all of the nettlesome details, I think it is useful to remember the first-order issue.  In its current form, the SEP is a problematic tool for describing the forecast rationale underlying the Committee’s policy decision.  As President Williams alluded to, theApril press conference, I thought, was particularly challenging—certainly to watch, and probably to experience in person.  Our goal, then, should be to find a better way to provide the Chairman, by the time of the press conference, with the information he needs to effectively communicate the role of the outlook in our policy decisions. I don’t think we are close to being at that point with the consensus forecast, and I am not really sure we can get there.  Of course, if the Chairman really wants this, we could try harder.  There are just too many issues to work out at the moment, from handling assumptions for a complete path for future policy to the conventions for endorsement.  We might be able to come up with a satisfactory way to handle the issues and produce an informative product by the time the minutes come out.  And we may want to pursue some experimentation with putting together a forecast conditioned on common policy assumptions consistent with the actions of the Committee at the meeting.  But I don’t see how we could ever do this in time for the postmeeting press conference.  Certainly, we could not do so without severely compromising the FOMC meeting itself as a deliberative process. I think, however, that we can make improvements to the SEP that would make it a much better tool.  First, at the press conference, I think we should highlight the median forecast of those Committee members voting for the policy.  True, this need not be as fully a coherent economic projection as the consensus forecast would be, but it has to be an improvement over 19 different viewpoints.  The median of the supporting voters would go a long way to describing the collective judgment that underlay the policy decision.  When we add in other members or participants who didn’t agree with the policy decision, it is not helpful for explaining any nuances in the decision.  We could go ahead and publish the median of the voters who were in favor of it, as well as the median of everyone.  There are all kinds of cuts of the data that we could produce if we chose to do that. It probably doesn’t surprise you that I would be willing to publish the entire matrix of SEP submissions myself. I am fine with doing that with attribution. If we can’t get there, I would at least identify the members voting for the policy decision, if that were possible.  With the matrix, the public would be able to see the individual projections and judge the rationales for themselves.  They could put together the scatter plots that they like—although the particular issue you were talking about, President Williams, would not be conveyed.  At a minimum, I would distribute these internally with attribution and also include balance sheet assumptions whenever possible.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing the difficulties and limitations of the consensus forecasting exercise and suggesting improvements to the SEP tool, but there is no direct disagreement or conflict mentioned.


Passage number 208.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The staff memo is quite persuasive in describing the challenges with the consensus forecast at this time.  Different weighting of the dual mandate, different views on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, as well as the many operational challenges in reaching a consensus with such a large committee—with members with rotating votes—make a quick resolution of these problems unlikely. It is important to focus on what the primary communication objective should be for this exercise.  My own view is that the most important objective for communication is to make clear what outlook for inflation and unemployment justifies the Committee’s policy decision as communicated through the statement.  The second most important objective is to make clear how unexpected changes in the path of inflation and unemployment are likely to influence future policy actions, particularly given that we are setting policy, at least in part, by being more explicit about our future intentions.  At this time, I do not believe a consensus forecast is the best way to meet either of my primary communication objectives.  I do believe that an enhanced SEP is the best way forward.  Each participant should provide a forecast based on the median forecast of the path of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet path from the previous SEP, which I would do at every meeting. This would eliminate the problem of vastly different policy variables being used as optimal policy.  At meetings where policy is changed, forecasts based on the previous SEP would presumably show outcomes that necessitated further action. I would prefer to make these submissions public with attribution.  The public would then see the views of those who supported the statement and those who did not.  This would avoid the problem of not distinguishing voters and nonvoters that occurred at the April meeting.  The public could also associate forecasts with those who are likely to be voting members in future years.  It also makes each participant accountable for his or her own forecasts, and the public could discount those forecasts that have large systematic errors or that have serious consistency problems.  However, there is a legitimate concern that attribution may make participants less willing to compromise during the meeting.  If disclosure with attribution does not have support, I would propose an enhanced SEP that distinguishes voters from nonvoters, based on the year they are voting.  I would release all of the variables by participant, but with the participants not identified. An enhanced SEP with full disclosure could begin with the first press conference next year.  That would give us time to work out any remaining concerns with the approach we adopt.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Bullard.

Passage number 209.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think the main thing we have to do here is define what we are trying to do, and I will give you my objective.  My objective is to provide  the public with a baseline Fed view of the likely path of the U.S. economy.  I would like to do that through a quarterly monetary policy report.  I view this as standard central bank practice around the world.  We should be able to do this as well.  I do not buy the argument that the United States can’t do it but everybody else can. I have more modest objectives than what the subcommittee seems to have in mind.  In particular, the core purpose, in my mind, is not to explain the rationale of the FOMC, but it is to get this baseline view out there, given assumptions about future policy that are in the market.  So my main comment is that the process around this should not be an attempt to make policy decisions through an agreement on forecasts outside of actual FOMC meetings, and I agree with President Evans on this.  This type of process is extremely cumbersome and, I think, should be abandoned.  It really takes away, maybe, from the integrity of the meeting. Here is my suggested approach: The forecast should be labeled as a staff forecast. It should essentially be a version of the information that is already used in the Tealbook.  That is number one. Number two, the policy assumption used should be a market-based one, as in the Bank of England case.  I was unconvinced by the memo discussion on this issue.  I think a market-based assumption would work well.  It could be that the market-based assumption is going to be different from what the Committee has in mind, but then we have to ask ourselves, well, why is this.  Have we not communicated effectively.  Do we not think that the outcomes that everyone else says are going to occur are satisfactory and we should adjust our policy appropriately. So I think if you are going to be a long way out of line with a market-based assumption, the Committee has some introspection to do on that.  I’ll stop on that. Finally, the third thing is that the timing of the quarterly monetary policy report should be divorced somewhat from the FOMC meeting itself, so that we are not in this position of trying to scramble around to put the statement out there.  I just don’t see it as being part of this process here, the meeting itself and any press conference, if there is a press conference associated with that particular meeting. So I would see this as a little bit of a different schedule.  One way to do that would be, during the middle of an intermeeting period, you could have an event where you give an updated Fed forecast, given the recent policy decision as it’s understood in markets at that point in time. I don’t oppose the changes to the SEP, but I would like to remind the Committee that much of the impetus for this was that there was dissatisfaction with the SEP.  So I don’t really see this as helpful, to go back to the SEP and then have the same list of complaints about it that we have had before. Identifying members is fine with me.  I am happy to discuss my forecast or my outlook on the economy and all kinds of issues at length.  But I think the main issue with the publication of names and voters, and so on, is that everyone really wants to know what the Chairman’s view is.  And once they have the Chairman’s view, they are not going to care about anyone else’s view, which is fine.  But, you know, are we really willing to go that far. So I think we would be better off with the approach that I am suggesting, which is to go to the staff forecast, put in market-based policy assumptions, get it a little bit offline with the actual meetings—either the same time as the minutes or a little bit after the minutes or somewhere else in the intermeeting period—and have it be quarterly. I do think it would provide a lot of information for financial market participants and the private sector in general, because they want to understand how the pieces fit together, at least from the staff’s perspective,understanding that you have lots of policymakers.  The policymakers have all kinds of different views, and that is good and helpful, but we don’t have to get into all of that just to give this baseline view of how things are working and what we expect to see in the future.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota.

Passage number 210.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As Governor Yellen was going through her commentary earlier, I found myself in substantial agreement with almost everything she said, then others also have supported much of that, and there have been other thoughts.  I’m just going to make a few points to try to add a little bit to the commentary this morning. In an earlier discussion some months ago, I made the sort of abstract point that the institutional setup of the FOMC makes a consensus decision more achievable than a consensus rationale for a decision.  I think this exercise makes that more clear as a practical matter, and I think it’s unavoidable that our communication is influenced by that reality.  So we’re not the Bank of England, and we’re not the Riksbank either. Whatever decision we make, I think it’s important to be clear about purposes; several have pointed that out.  Particularly, what I consider to be a primary purpose of this communication tool is to equip the Chairman to explain in his press conference why a policy decision was made and what it’s expected to accomplish. As I weighed the arguments in the staff memo, the balance of pros and cons seemed to me to lean in favor of abandoning the consensus forecast and settling for an improved SEP.  I would support the suggestions made by the staff in the memo, for the most part.  The median of voters—I like the idea of the median of supporters, if that could be compiled quickly between the time of the end of the meeting and the time of the press conference.   I support publishing the full matrix of submission information.  I’m a bit uncomfortable with full attribution to the public, name by name. I made this argument, again, some months ago, and it’s important.  I say this word carefully.  I don’t want to encourage Kremlinology— that’s different from criminology [laughter]—Kremlinology that just feeds the beast of articles about who said what exactly and tries to create dissension within the Committee that may, in fact, not exist or at least not be that material. So let me just take a second and say if we were to go forward with another trial of the consensus forecast—and I’m not totally ready to throw in the towel—I think it’s obvious a key requirement is a common policy assumption going into the forecast exercise.  As I think about it, there are three options: The first is the policy status quo ante, but that doesn’t help in the press conference because that basically says what the policy as it existed before the meeting would accomplish in terms of a forecast, and that doesn’t help if we make a decision in the meeting. The second would be a summary of market expectations, probably derived from the dealer survey. I can’t get comfortable with having, essentially, the external world dictate our base assumption for a forecast.  It just seems to me to be too dependent on outside opinion, which in some cases diverges from opinion within the Committee. Then the third option I see is that the Chairman defines an assumption, perhaps broad enough to be inclusive of what seems to be the consensus going into the meeting about the path of policy.  I think that is sort of similar in spirit to the approach in one trial where the Chairman was going to summarize the forecast and come back to us with a summary statement that then we were going to decide whether we bought into or didn’t buy into.  So if the Chairman were comfortable doing this, I think he might just provide an adequate enough assumption of the   policy.  None of these is ideal.  To be ready for a press conference, a forecast based on the actual decision is not really feasible.  So it does appear to be extremely difficult. If we adopt a consensus forecast approach, I do favor doing the exercise for each meeting.  I don’t think we can render half the meetings more equal than the other half.  I think this would require a press conference after each meeting, and knowing the Chairman’s view on this [laughter], that may be the final nail in the coffin.  So those are my comments.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman.

The speaker begins by expressing agreement with Governor Yellen's commentary and states that others have also supported her views. The speaker then goes on to make some points of his own to add to the discussion. While he mentions some potential concerns or reservations about certain proposals, he does not express outright disagreement or contention.


Passage number 211.
 MR. STEIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I agree that it makes sense to table the consensus forecast project for now.  The limitations have been pretty well explained, both in the memo and by others who have spoken before me.  So I won’t pile on here.In terms of modifying the SEP, I’m agreeable with many of the things that have been proposed.  In particular, I think it’s a good idea to publish the median projection of the voters supporting the statement.  Publishing the scatter plot seems also like a good thing to do.  I’m perfectly open to the idea of doing the matrix, preferably anonymized, and also I think it’s probably a good idea to circulate our stuff internally with people’s names.  That’s pretty much it.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  Governor Powell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker states that they agree with the decision to table the consensus forecast project and also agree with proposed modifications to the SEP. They express support for publishing the median projection, scatter plot, and potentially a matrix, as well as circulating internal materials with names.


Passage number 212.
 MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I also agree that the consensus forecast is not doable now, although I would say that I think there may be something still in the idea of a quarterly monetary policy report, either with or without a consensus forecast.  I think it’s worth holding that thought aside from this for now. As far as the SEP is concerned, I’m comfortable with most of the ideas that have been put forward.  I would publish the median projection of voters.  For that matter, all of the medians are essentially empirically identical, and I’m comfortable with publishing any of them. I’d publish the scatter plot, and I would identify voters on it, but not by name. I would not try to publish the balance sheet projections, just for the reasons that I don’t know what you do with an open-ended program and I also think you’re going to wind up being dragged into a policy discussion over that again, which has been the thing that brought down the consensus forecast. I would go ahead and publish the full matrix.  I would not do it with names.  I just think the issue with names is that it has the potential to change outcomes to bring forward human traits, like risk aversion and reluctance to admit error, that I see others experiencing from time to   time.  And finally, I would be very happy to circulate—in fact, I thought we already did this— the projections internally under our own names.  I can’t think of a good reason not to do that. And let me end with a thought that maybe we could have an inertial component to our SEP publication function and maybe put a toe in the water by publishing the medians first and then move into the scatter plot and/or the matrix over time.  Just a thought. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Thank you very much.  This was actually a very informative go-round.  It is important to remind ourselves of the goal, which is both to show the diversity of views and to provide a coherent outlook that justifies the Committee’s decisions.  So I think both of those things are important. There was general consensus that we should abandon for now, perhaps not permanently, the consensus forecast exercise and focus on improvements in the SEP.  Under the heading of the SEP, there were a number of things that got specific attention, and it would be easy enough to go around and figure out how many supported each.  The median voter idea, the scatter plots, the matrix, and possibly balance sheet information were ones that got mentioned considerably. President Bullard was one of the few who wanted to continue with the consensus forecast, in which he was not joined by many people, but he also mentioned the QMPR, the quarterly monetary policy report, and President Plosser and Governor Powell mentioned that point as well. I think we should consider this a less-urgent issue at this point, but I myself also think that converting the existing congressional semiannual report and including information from Tealbook, Book A, could provide a very useful document at some point in the future, including SEP information or however we wanted to do that.  Again, this is not something we want to do immediately because of the press of the priorities that we are facing, but perhaps this is something we can keep in the back of our minds as we go forward.  What I’d like to do, if Janet is willing, is to ask her and her subcommittee, with the help of staff, to make some tentative recommendations back to the full Committee.  In December we have a quarterly SEP, and we can simply try them out; we can just look and see.  If you propose one particular statistic, we can look at what that is, and we can have a brief discussion, at least a presentation of what those numbers look like in the context of the December SEP.  And then based on that, perhaps we can decide to go live in the subsequent meeting. President Kocherlakota.
