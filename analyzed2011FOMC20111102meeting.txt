Passage number 1.
 MR. FISHER.  Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Unlike some operators on Wall Street, we at the Federal Open Market Committee do pay our debts in full.  [Laughter]  I have a debt that I need to pay back to the gentleman on my left.  [Laughter]  I am tempted to claw his eyes out and scratch his legs during the meeting, but instead, being honorable, this is the bet.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statements made by Mr. Fisher are intended to be humorous and light-hearted. The laughter indicates that the audience is finding his remarks amusing.


Passage number 2.
  [Laughter] MR. BULLARD.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage is simply indicating the presence of laughter without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 3.
  Let the record show— MR. FISHER.  This is beer.  This is the elixir of working men and women, and I never resist giving some facts.  Beer is the third-most consumed liquid product in the world after water and beer.  It goes back to at least the Neolithic Period, 9,500 B.C.  There was a goddess of beer that the Sumerians have called Ninkasi.  And there is a famous prayer that is called “The Hymn to Ninkasi.”  I evoked it so many times during the sixth game, but I found out that Ninkasi, whoever she was, gave way to the god of Bud.  There it is, Shiner Bock, the best of Texas beers.  I would have brought you a Lone Star, but real men and women don’t drink light beer.  [Laughter] Mr. Chairman, thank you for giving us this opportunity.  I won’t tell you how I snuck it into this room.  I never want to go through that security procedure again.  [Laughter]  But you won, congratulations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a light-hearted and jovial discussion about beer.


Passage number 4.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, sir.  And a great World Series it was.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the World Series was great.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 5.
 MR. FISHER.  It was a terrible World Series.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The use of the word "terrible" implies a negative opinion or disagreement about the World Series.


Passage number 6.
  [Laughter] MR. TARULLO.  What were you going to pay up if he won.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It consists of a simple question and laughter.


Passage number 7.
 MR. BULLARD.  A six-pack of the local brew.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions a six-pack of a local brew.


Passage number 8.
 MR. WILCOX.  Bud Light.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only mentions the name "Mr. Wilcox" and "Bud Light." It does not provide any context or information that could indicate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 9.
  [Laughter] MR. BULLARD.  Bud Light, Busch. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Meeting is adjourned.  [Laughter] Let’s turn to item 1 on the agenda.  The retirement of Dave Stockton opens up a vacancy.  We propose to select David Wilcox as economist for the FOMC, and Larry Slifman as associate economist, effective until the organizational meeting in January 2012.  No objections.  [No response]  All right.  Thank you very much. Let’s turn now to item 2 on monetary policy frameworks.  Let me begin the discussion by turning to Michael Kiley, who will lead the staff presentation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The participants in the meeting are calmly discussing and making decisions without any objections or responses.


Passage number 10.
 MR. KILEY.  In all of the cases, whether it is nominal GDP targeting or the inertial Taylor rule approach, policy is actually governed by a rule, not by a pure targeting approach.  So, there is no specific objective for how quickly nominal income approaches its target. We assumed that the policy strategy would be highly inertial so that policy adjustments would be very slow.  We did that because the policy literature suggests that in many models, highly inertial policies are a really good idea.  Those strategies imply that nominal income hits the target, depending on which model, late this decade or under some of the models even later.  In the FRB/US model, nominal income would hit the target around, say, 2018 and overshoot.  In the EDO model, it hits around the same time, and there is no nominal GDP overshooting.  It essentially hits that level.  In the small model we considered, because inflation is so inertial, it could take even longer, and nominal GDP wouldn’t hit the target over the next 5 to 10 years.  The answer to the question depends upon the model and the specific degree to which the nominal income targeting is inertial. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  How do you communicate how aggressively you are going to respond to the gap.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is explaining the different models and their implications for nominal income targeting without presenting conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 11.
 MR. KILEY.  One way to communicate that would be by laying out a simple policy rule, and that obviously was what we did in all of the models and is one thing that is robust across models.  It doesn’t depend on when nominal income achieves target.  Showing how you would change policy in response to nominal income doesn’t depend on a specific model’s rate at which the nominal income gap closes, but, rather, depends on your model.  Then, one could explain that in terms of your baseline outlook for nominal income or—  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  Thank you.  Other questions.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is explaining a concept and stating that it is robust across models. There is no contradiction or argument in the statements made.


Passage number 12.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I wanted to ask about the optimal policy under discretion.  You say that you assume the Committee aims for a target of 2 percent.  I am wondering, does the policymaker choose what inflation rate we desire in the long run.  Or do you hold that constant.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Lacker is simply asking for clarification about the policymaker's ability to choose the desired inflation rate in the long run.


Passage number 13.
 MR. KILEY.  It is a period-by-period choice for the policy rate, given a long-run objective.  The policymaker is trying to choose where inflation and unemployment will go on a period-by-period basis.  They don’t reconsider the 2 percent inflation objective.  That is hardwired into a policymaker’s DNA.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is explaining the decision-making process of a policymaker and their long-run objective. It does not mention any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 14.
 MR. LACKER.  In a sense, there is some commitment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. Lacker is making a statement.


Passage number 15.
 MR. KILEY.  That is right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This is a simple affirmation of a statement.


Passage number 16.
 MR. LACKER.  Thus the quotes around “discretion.”  So the Taylor rule is not time-consistent, and it describes what we do pretty well, right.  Is that true.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker seems to be stating a fact or making an observation, rather than expressing any disagreement with another party.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 17.
 MR. KILEY.  Any simple instrument rule will not be the optimal discretionary policy.  There would be an incentive to deviate from it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. In the passage, Mr. Kiley is stating that a simple instrument rule would not be the best discretionary policy because there would be an incentive to deviate from it. This implies a disagreement or contention about the effectiveness of a simple instrument rule as an optimal policy.


Passage number 18.
 MR. LACKER.  Right.  The extent to which the Taylor rule captures how we behave now, is it your judgment that we behave with some greater level of commitment than is embodied in your optimal policy with discretion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 19.
 MR. KILEY.  As I noted, we would view the historical approach of the Committee as one consistent with constrained discretion.  Clearly the Committee doesn’t adjust policy willy-nilly and doesn’t reconsider on a meeting-by-meeting basis every aspect of its strategy.  Definitely, there are commitments. Indeed, under the discretion case, as you noted, we take a number of commitments off the table and assume that, for example, an inflation objective of 2 percent is hardwired in the policymaker’s DNA.  In addition, policy communications have given guidance regarding the outlook for the federal funds rate, for example, and I am sure the Committee and the public view those as conditional commitments.  It would be false to suggest that the policy approach involves zero commitments.  The optimal discretionary case here involves a number of commitments as well, and the extent to which there could be gains from further commitment is consistent with the story that we have told in illustrating commitment versus discretion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 20.
 MR. LACKER.  I have one other question, Mr. Chairman, if I could.  You have an objective function that you carry across these scenarios and across models that has the policymaker minimizing this weighted sum.  On the unemployment side, it is the deviation of unemployment from a u* that is fixed, that is a constant.  Am I right about that, or is it the Tealbook’s NAIRU.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is seeking clarification on a specific aspect of the objective function.


Passage number 21.
  MR. KILEY.  There are the modest movements in the Tealbook’s natural rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states the existence of modest movements in the Tealbook's natural rate.


Passage number 22.
 MR. LACKER.  Is it the natural rate that is adjusted for the extended unemployment benefits.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It only asks a question about whether the natural rate is adjusted for extended unemployment benefits.


Passage number 23.
 MR. KILEY.  It is.  That is not particularly important, because that is only an adjustment in the next year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Kiley.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 24.
 MR. LACKER.  In the model EDO, you start from preferences, endowments, and technologies, and, principally, you could derive the right loss function, right.  And it wouldn’t have the same property that the u* is some fixed, smooth thing.  Am I right about that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, is expressing disagreement with the idea that the u* (a variable in the model EDO) is a fixed and smooth thing. He suggests that the loss function derived from preferences, endowments, and technologies does not possess this property.


Passage number 25.
 MR. KILEY.  Yes, that’s correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Kiley simply agrees with the statement or question that was made.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 26.
 MR. LACKER.  There is this dichotomy here, right.  The change in the unemployment insurance, the richness of those—it is a kind of a shock, right.  You guys take that on board for NAIRU, but you don’t take on board any of the other shocks that have hit the economy in the past few years.  Have you guys thought about that dichotomy, that contrast.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lacker points out a dichotomy or contrast between how the Federal Reserve takes into account the change in unemployment insurance but does not consider other shocks that have affected the economy. He implies that this selective approach may be inconsistent or unfair.


Passage number 27.
 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Before this recession we thought the NAIRU was 4¾ percent.  Now we think, leaving aside the effects of extended unemployment benefits, things like that, it is 6 percent.  When you ratchet that up, that is a very persistent hit to labor market functioning, relative to what we thought. We have also gone back and taken a look at what it was prior to the recession.  I don’t think it was quite as low as 4¾ percent.  But we have assumed that—through very persistent reduced attachment to the labor force, through duration of employment, through long duration of employment hurting people’s skills, things like that—there are persistent fallout effects, supply-side effects.  As Mike said, those effects are taken into account in these analyses.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting information and analysis regarding the NAIRU (non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment) and the persistent effects of the recession on the labor market.


Passage number 28.
 MR. LACKER.  That results in a figure that is really smooth, and the vision you’d get out of EDO is that every quarter’s TFP shock should affect the natural rate.  There is still a bit of a bucket of left-out shocks there.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply discusses the method used to calculate a figure and mentions a small remaining factor that is not accounted for.


Passage number 29.
 MR. KILEY.  That is technically true.  In much of the literature actually incorporating unemployment in models like EDO—in practice, that is not the result that comes out.  The natural rate of unemployment is often very smooth.  In addition, it is important to be consistent across all the implications of a model if one wants to push the story that far.  For example, in EDO, given the definition of the natural rate of unemployment that you are suggesting, that would be higher.  It is also the case that there is a natural rate of interest that should be accounted for in a model like that, and that is actually much, much lower because of the effect on financial frictions estimated by that model.  If you take both of those factors into account, you would want policy to be even easier than in a model like FRB/US.  One shouldn’t cherry-pick a particular implication of a model.  One needs to walk through the analysis very consistently, and it is not always what one thinks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It is primarily focused on discussing different aspects and implications of economic models.


Passage number 30.
 MR. LACKER.  Perfectly fair. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Raskin. MS. RASKIN.  Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  One question, Michael, from an operational perspective on the nominal income targeting, and that has to do with whether the activity component of nominal income is known in a timely way and as a reliable data point sufficient to permit adjustment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speakers are simply acknowledging and agreeing with each other's statements.


Passage number 31.
 MR. KILEY.  One could have different opinions on that.  At the current juncture, I think the answer is clearly yes, the data are timely enough.  Over the period that we are considering these strategies, nominal income would provide a reliable enough signal, because we are not talking about whether the federal funds rate should be up or down 25 basis points this quarter, and then adjusted next quarter.  We are looking at a situation in which, in our estimation, a plausible nominal income gap is about 7 percent.  The measurement error or the degree of revision in nominal income is just not that high, but there are revisions. It is certainly possible that when the economy is back closer to steady-state conditions that that type of a consideration would be important from meeting to meeting.  I think that’s something that one wants to consider when one is thinking about whether or not an intermediate target like nominal income is appropriate for the next 5 to 10 years or is appropriate forevermore. And the answer to that question is that it doesn’t have to be the same.  Right now we are in extraordinary times.  One of the problems with nominal income targeting—that we are not exactly sure about the level of nominal income this quarter—is actually not that important right now, even though 10 years from now I hope that that is a really important consideration. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is acknowledging that different opinions can be had on the topic, but ultimately states that current data is timely enough to use nominal income as an intermediate target. The speaker also mentions that while measurement error and revisions exist, they are not currently significant factors in the decision-making process.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 32.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you.  I have a question.  It seems like the way you have presented it implies that the nominal GDP targeting implied a lower trigger or a lower threshold for exit.  Do you need the actual framework of nominal GDP targeting to generate these outcomes.  Or could you just actually have the lower trigger threshold.  And would that be sufficient.  I mean, how does the staff view the articulation of the framework vis-à-vis how that maps into the trigger.  I am not sure I am being clear.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is questioning whether the nominal GDP targeting framework is necessary for achieving certain outcomes or if a lower trigger threshold would be sufficient. They are unsure about how the staff views the relationship between the framework and the trigger.


Passage number 33.
 MR. KILEY.  I am not sure that there is a uniform step.  The way that I would think about it is that certainly within a given model, or a given view of the world, specifying a trigger and an outlook for the funds rate is the same as saying that you want a target for nominal GDP.  But as I noted earlier when we were talking about the rate at which nominal GDP might approach its target, those implications are not robust necessarily across different views of the world; whereas reference to a set of goals—and those could be unemployment goals and inflation goals, those could be nominal income, those could be something else—may be more consistent across frameworks. The way that I would view it is that there is some distinction between simply saying the funds rate is going to be a certain value for the next X quarters and a framework, because the framework provides information to individuals who have a different view.  And over time they will learn whether their view is confirmed or disputed by the data and presumably update their expectations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing their own view on the distinction between specifying a trigger and an outlook for the funds rate versus a framework, and how different views can be consistent or not across different frameworks. There is no disagreement or argument being presented.


Passage number 34.
  VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I am trying to get at a point—how much of the benefit do you get by having the trigger values out there versus the framework out there.  I am trying to understand how you parse those two things.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is expressing an inquiry and a desire to understand the relationship between trigger values and a framework in order to determine the extent of their individual benefits. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 35.
 MR. KILEY.  Certainly, under the baseline outlook you get some of the benefit from the trigger and some of the benefit from the overall framework.  And then, in the shocks, when things turn out different than you expect, the triggers don’t necessarily tell you what is going to happen in all cases, because they may involve differences in policy in periods after the trigger has happened.  The framework provides some of the benefit.   In the simulations, or in the forward-guidance memo, triggers that signal additional policy accommodation are helpful at the current time, if one wants to improve outcomes for resource utilization.  But there appear to be some gains from moving beyond that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing the benefits and limitations of triggers and the framework in different scenarios. They also mention the potential gains from moving beyond triggers.


Passage number 36.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 37.
 MR. WILCOX.  It would be difficult to analyze that question, in principle, in your models, because the agents in your models understand exactly what the framework is.  I think what Michael is saying is that communication clarity is key to the difference between a trigger strategy and a nominal income-targeting strategy, and communication isn’t an issue that is salient in the model.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a statement explaining a point made by Michael regarding the importance of communication clarity in different strategies. The speaker acknowledges the difficulty of analyzing the question in their models but agrees with Michael's viewpoint.


Passage number 38.
 MR. KILEY.  Yes, that is the hard part. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  On the other hand, nominal income targeting is only an approximation of the optimal path, so a lot depends on the quality of the approximation as well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is acknowledging that nominal income targeting is not perfect and that its effectiveness depends on how well it approximates the optimal path.


Passage number 39.
 MR. KILEY.  Right.  And certainly, across different models is a less-good approximation.  We had one example of nominal income targeting a specific rule, changing those parameters slightly.  It is not going to be quite as good an approximation of the optimal policy rule. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating a fact and discussing the limitations of a specific example.


Passage number 40.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Thanks for the great memo, and thanks for the great presentation, Michael.  I had two quick questions.  One is, in exhibit 3, when I look at PCE prices under nominal income targeting, the graph ends in 2018, and we are still above 3 percent.  How long do we stay above 2 percent in that simulation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It shows gratitude and a request for clarification but does not express any conflicting views or arguments.


Passage number 41.
 MR. KILEY.  This is a huge shock, so the economy takes a long time to get back to steady state.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is describing a situation where the economy takes a long time to return to a stable condition, indicating a shock or disruption.


Passage number 42.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes, I agree with that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage states that Mr. Kocherlakota agrees with something, indicating that there is no contention or disagreement.


Passage number 43.
 MR. KILEY.  It doesn’t actually take that long to get back to 2 percent.  This is sort of the peak, and it starts coming down and will be going back closely to 2 percent in the several years after that.  But the economy won’t settle down.  It will undershoot, and then it will come back up, because the economy under this particular policy strategy, which is just focusing on nominal income, will be oscillating in toward that steady state for a while under the FRB/US model.  That is not necessarily true in all the models.  But as I noted, part of the success of that strategy in this scenario is this willingness to have inflation go to 3 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 44.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I agree, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage simply states that Mr. Kocherlakota agrees, indicating that there is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 45.
 MR. KILEY.  We certainly did simulations in which, when you see that, you just back off and want to give up on nominal income targeting.  That trims the gains and puts it closer to the Taylor-type strategy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating a hypothetical situation where simulations may lead someone to give up on nominal income targeting. They mention that this would trim the gains and put it closer to a Taylor-type strategy, but there is no indication of disagreement or contention within the statement.


Passage number 46.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thanks.  That was useful.  This is not my second question.  It is more of a follow-up.  I think that this gets back to something that President Lacker was asking about discretion.  One thing that might be interesting to know is the size of the losses that are being forgone by a discretionary FOMC as we go along these scenarios.  If you are in 2017, and the inflation rate is at 3 percent and unemployment is down under 4, what is that FOMC thinking about how much they are forgoing in terms of the losses.  I think that would help us understand how credible these kinds of plans are.  I don’t know if I was making sense or not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a follow-up question seeking clarification and information.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 47.
 MR. KILEY.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 

Explanation: The word "Yes" indicates that there is contention or disagreement in the following passage. However, without the actual passage provided, it is not possible to determine the specific details or context of the disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 48.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  My second question is, what is the size of our shortfall, in terms of nominal GDP, right now.  The staff has an estimate of potential, and I think the shortfall right now is being calculated relative to that notion of potential GDP, and that comes to be about 7 percent in the current quarter relative to where we were starting in December ’07 or something like that, fourth quarter ’07.  Many outside observers would say that the gap is actually 4 percentage points bigger than that because they are using some kind of trend line from December ’07 to be their guidepost. The challenge right now is, how do we start to communicate about our nuanced measures of potential GDP to the public relative to just drawing the straight trend line, which I think is more what people are used to.  I will speak for myself.  When I try to communicate to the public about how deep this episode has been, I use the trend line.  For one thing, I think potential GDP is Class II FOMC information, so I am not able to talk about it.  [Laughter]  But more seriously, it is a challenge for us to say that we are going to do nominal income targeting, but, by the way, we don’t view ourselves as responsible for 4 percentage points of what you think of as a shortfall.  It is a communication issue that might be hard. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in this passage. Mr. Kocherlakota and the outside observers have different views on the size of the shortfall in nominal GDP. Mr. Kocherlakota argues that the shortfall is about 7 percent, while the outside observers argue that it is 4 percentage points bigger than that. This difference in opinion is a source of contention in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 49.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  And thank you, Michael, for the presentation and the analysis.  I love this kind of stuff; I am a big fan. I have a couple of comments.  One is, when we talk about price-level targeting, I thought it got a little jumbled, because I guess you are talking about what I would call strict price-level targeting.  When I think back to the original Svensson paper on this, he took this objective that had the output gap and inflation in it, and he replaced inflation with price-level targeting.  The output gap was still there, so to me, when we went to the price-level-targeting argument, it was all there, and so there wasn’t anything that indicated that price-level targeting means that you are going to ignore the real side of the economy.  There wasn’t anything like that.  To have price-level targeting get a bad name from this memo, which is what is happening, I think is a little unfair to the approach.  The price level was supposed to substitute for the commitment that wasn’t there when you had the inflation rates there.  That was a pretty good insight and has been verified in subsequent models. You can go to nominal income targeting instead, but you could also go to flexible price-level targeting.  What is the difference between those two is really the question.  What is the difference between flexible price-level targeting, as I would see it originally envisioned by Svensson, and nominal income targeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Bullard, disagrees with the "memo" that is giving price-level targeting a bad name and argues that it is unfair to criticize the approach. He believes that price-level targeting does not mean ignoring the real side of the economy and that it was a valuable insight. He also questions the difference between flexible price-level targeting and nominal income targeting.


Passage number 50.
 MR. KILEY.  Nominal income targeting is just one example of flexible price-level targeting.  Because there are an infinite number of examples of flexible price-level targeting, we picked the polar cases that are easy, round numbers; we picked 0 on the output gap, strict price-level targeting, and 1 on the output gap, nominal income targeting.  But you are absolutely right that flexible price-level targeting is the best thing to do in some models, and we just chose to focus on the one case.  People have some empirical papers that have considered flexible price-level targeting.  For example, the one by Gorodnichenko and Shapiro, let’s say they have a coefficient of 1 plus some inertia on the price level, and then an even bigger coefficient on the output gap than 1.  They would be even more aggressive than nominal income targeting.  So one, of course, could have a smaller coefficient on the output gap, and performance would be sensitive to those assumptions.  But one would move from “price-level targeting performed poorly” in a couple of the models we considered to “nominal income targeting performed reasonably well” in those models.  One would move in that direction as one became more flexible in price-level targeting and put some weight on the output gap.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges that there are different approaches to flexible price-level targeting and the choices made in the discussion are based on specific examples. The speaker also recognizes the variability in performance depending on different assumptions.


Passage number 51.
 MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  Thank you.  One thing about this memo that I thought was not addressed—from the perspective of this Committee—is, what are we really worried about.  We are worried that you are playing with fire, and you might replay a really bad scenario in which inflation goes up a lot, and you really get into a lot of trouble. What would it take in this kind of framework to get into that kind of hot water.  The answer might be there is no scenario under which that can happen, but the ’70s did happen.  I think you have to have something in the model that goes too far and really generates a lot of problems.  Otherwise, the question would be, why don’t you just commit to zero rates out to 2030, if it is all beneficial.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Bullard is expressing his concerns and raising questions about potential risks and scenarios, but there is no indication of disagreement or contentious debate.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 52.
 MR. KILEY.  I agree.  That is a really hard question, and certainly things can go wrong.  It is hard to know what those are.  I think if one committed to interest rates of some fixed path until 2030, things would be very likely to go wrong.  That is why we talk about strategies that would be conditional on economic outcomes. In terms of what could trigger a repeat of the 1970s, obviously, I don’t know.  It is notable that nominal income targeting was proposed in the late 1970s by people like Jim Tobin and James Meade, precisely because inflation was a problem.  Then, a subsequent analysis by people in the 1980s—Marty Feldstein, Greg Mankiw, many people—showed it is a good strategy in response to those kind of shocks.  The idea, actually, was to prevent that kind of outcome.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges that committing to a fixed path of interest rates until 2030 could go wrong, but argues for conditional strategies based on economic outcomes instead. This suggests a disagreement with the idea of fixed interest rates. Additionally, the mention of proponents and opponents of nominal income targeting in the 1970s and 1980s indicates a historical debate and differing perspectives on the effectiveness of that strategy.


Passage number 53.
 MR. BULLARD.  I just have one more comment, which President Lacker has already brought up, which is, how fair is it to characterize what the Committee does now as a discretionary policy.  In some sense, if you have a Taylor rule, maybe it is a simple Taylor rule, maybe it is not the optimal one, but you can pick the coefficients to be as good as they can be for that particular Taylor rule.  That will probably get you pretty close to the optimal outcome.  You are committing to the rule, you always behave like the rule, so in a sense there is a lot of commitment already there.  How much can you really improve on that, as opposed to the literature, which says that you are always choosing the discretionary solution at every point in time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage is not presenting any explicit contention or disagreement. It is discussing the characterization of the Committee's current policy as discretionary and questioning the potential for improvement compared to following a specific rule. However, there are no conflicting opinions or arguments being presented.


Passage number 54.
 MR. KILEY.  There is one important aspect of commitment that isn’t captured by the Taylor rule.  In all of our baselines, the Committee is committed to following some reasonable strategy.  The baseline is always a simple rule—the outcome-based rule or something like that. The types of commitment strategies that Dave and Chris and I were talking about move beyond that simple rule, because they involve some commitment to undo undesirable movements in the price level.  So one is willing to have inflation run at 2½ percent for a while, for example, if unemployment is very high, to a degree that is greater than embedded in something like a Taylor rule.  That is an insight in the policy literature that can be a good idea, and that is behavior inconsistent with simple policy rules that involve inflation.  That price-level-type aspect of nominal income targeting or the optimal commitment strategy or price-level targeting does move beyond the types of commitments that the Committee has, for the most part, been willing to make in the past. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is providing an explanation of a concept and there is no disagreement or contention being expressed.


Passage number 55.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have two less deep, more mundane questions about the charts that I’d like to see if I understand.  Under nominal GDP targeting, nominal GDP is the sum of real GDP plus the GDP deflator, and yet you’re talking about what’s going on with the PCE price index.  If you’re really targeting nominal GDP, you’re targeting the GDP deflator implicitly, right.  How in your calculation do you make that translation, and how do you think about that, again, as another communication device about what we’re doing.  That’s the first question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply a question seeking clarification on a technical aspect.


Passage number 56.
 MR. KILEY.  First, I’ll give you technically what we did.  This is a question very similar to the question Governor Raskin asked in terms of its implications at the current juncture.  What we did mechanically is not be particularly concerned about any trend differences in GDP prices and core PCE prices, and we set the target for 2 percent for GDP prices, and that’s slightly different than a target for 2 percent for core PCE prices or for overall PCE prices. During normal times—when we are there, 5 to 10 years from now—that would be really important if one’s very concerned about 2 versus 2.2 percent.  If the gap in nominal income is 7 percent, 2 or 2.2 percent just doesn’t matter.  It’s not important for the types of simulations we’re doing right now, but it is important for behavior potentially at other times.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply providing technical information and explaining the importance of certain factors in different situations.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 57.
 MR. PLOSSER.  The second question is sort of related to this.  A lot of the level targeting, whether it be price-level targeting or nominal GDP–level targeting, can be quite sensitive to where the path begins, whether you start at December ’07 or whether you start at December 2000 or 2003 or what have you.  When we think about targeting the level for anything, the sensitivity perhaps to that initial condition, how do we think about choosing what the right initial condition was.  Certainly, December 2007 was the peak of the housing bubble and perhaps some other things that you might want to think about.  And yet if you go back earlier, as President Lacker has talked about, the inflation rates of 2005 and 2006 were high.  I’m thinking about the sensitivity and how we would think about implementing a policy and choosing the right initial condition to measure what you think, in fact, the gap is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The disagreement arises from the different perspectives on what the right initial condition should be when targeting a level for anything. Mr. Plosser mentions that starting at different points in time can greatly affect the sensitivity of level targeting, while also highlighting the peak of the housing bubble in December 2007 as a potential starting point. On the other hand, President Lacker brings up the high inflation rates in 2005 and 2006 as another consideration for the right initial condition. This disagreement highlights the different views on what factors should be considered and how they should be weighed when choosing the right initial condition for policy implementation.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 58.
  Since you took my name in vain, I do feel constrained to mention— MR. EVANS.  No, I thought it was good.  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  But I do think I need to clarify that those comments were directed at the country that actually was suffering significant deflation, and so it was failing on both the price stability and the economic growth.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Evans, disagrees with the statement that his comments were good and instead feels the need to clarify the intent behind his comments. This shows that there is contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 59.
 MR. EVANS.  Yes, I think you’re right.  I understand that, and in fact, I spent a little more time reading Friedman and Schwartz and The Great Contraction, and at the end of that lovely chapter, they had this section on why monetary policy was so inept.  And I remember back to the lovely Milton Friedman celebration of his 90th birthday party where you gave a speech where—with Milton Friedman in the front row, attentive as always after a very long night before and that morning and afternoon—you assured him that the Federal Reserve had, indeed, caused mischief in the ’30s, and that we wouldn’t do it again. I looked at that chapter, and I totally agree with you that you have been faithful to that.  During the contraction, there were policies that should have been taken that were not, that could have prevented deflation and the Depression.  I agree with that.  I think we could do more, though.  That’s all I’m saying.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  A two-handed intervention, President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker agrees with the previous statement and expresses that they agree and also believe more could be done.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 60.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The dialogue that you and President Evans just had is relevant when we think about the Eggertson and Woodford model and the Werning model.  I have to admit I understand the Werning model a little better, but in those models, basically, price-level targeting works extremely well, except for the presence of the zero lower bound.  It means in some settings that you’re not able to keep prices growing at 2 percent or constant.  If you’re ever in a situation where you’re meeting your price-stability mandate in the Werning model, if you’re doing well on that and hitting 2 percent, 2 percent, 2 percent, you do not have a problem in that model.  That’s also true in Eggertson and Woodford. I think it’s important to make this distinction that you just made between that and Japan and the U.S. in the ’30s, that those were situations where you could easily point to problems on the price-stability mandate and see that the central bank is not behaving optimally.  I think it’s more challenging in our current environment where, as you expect in Minneapolis, we’ve done extremely well on our price-stability mandate—over the past four or  five years, we’ve done very well on it.  There are some differences of opinion about how well we’re going to be doing going forward, but even there the differences of opinion are relatively minor compared to what we saw in Japan. I think when we look at these New Keynesian models—they’re very hard to bring support for the kind of commitment policies that President Evans has in mind because we’re just not that far away from our price-stability mandate. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, obviously this will be taken up in some length.  [Laughter]  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Kocherlakota agrees with the idea of price-level targeting in the Werning model and the Eggertson and Woodford model. However, he disagrees with President Evans' belief in commitment policies because he believes that the current environment is already meeting the price-stability mandate, unlike the situations in Japan and the U.S. in the '30s.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 61.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  President Evans was quite eloquent and expansive.  [Laughter]  I have a great deal of sympathy with his views.  I’ll take a different strategy and use a little more brevity in my remarks. In terms of question 1, flexible inflation targeting can be consistent with the dual mandate, but being clear about exactly what is meant is critical.  Some use the term to place a heavy weight on inflation and a small but nonzero weight on employment.  Others use it to imply a lexicographic preference between inflation and unemployment, that is, as long as we are below the inflation target, we have the flexibility to address large output gaps.  I would be opposed to either of these interpretations of flexible inflation targeting.  What I would support is a quadratic loss function with roughly equal weights on inflation and unemployment as in the optimal policy simulations in the Tealbook, Book B.  Were we close to the inflation target but far from our estimate of full employment, we would be accommodative to reduce the quadratic loss function.  Were we close to full employment but well above our inflation target, we would have more restrictive policy to return to our inflation target and reduce our loss function. In terms of question 2, our current approach of using calendar dates to signal the first increase in the funds rate is potentially problematic if we are not willing to adjust it to changing circumstances.  For example, significantly greater downside risks or worse-than-expected economic outcomes after the date is set, so that economic conditions are no longer consistent with the original calendar date.  I would prefer to announce our intent to remain at the zero bound until we hit specific economic triggers, such as an unemployment rate at or below 7 percent and an inflation rate of 3 percent or higher.  Of course, we would not view such triggers as absolute and independent of all other economic conditions.  For example, a forecast of exceptionally strong or weak growth as we approached a trigger might force us to take action earlier or later.  I would strongly support moving to conditional commitments, such as the example in option A.   In terms of question 3, I would support considering moving to nominal GDP targeting if it is necessary to forcefully convey a change in regime.  It would be most appropriate if we want to signal a regime change that requires more aggressive policies moving forward.  I view nominal GDP targeting as preferable to price-level targeting because it is easier to communicate, performs better in simulations, and does not emphasize just one element of the dual mandate.An announcement that nominal GDP targeting was necessary to get much stronger growth in output is understandable to the public and could be effective if it was conveyed in conjunction with more aggressive actions. In terms of question 4, we need to be clear what we’re trying to communicate.  If we’re trying to communicate why we were taking policy actions, then enforcing a common interest rate path across all participants, such as an assumption of no change in interest rates or the interest rate path embedded in the futures market, may be appropriate.  If our policy differs from the assumptions, we would show that our forecast with those assumptions is not consistent with our goals and use that communication to justify a different policy than what was used in the forecast.  A potential problem is that it may be difficult to make clear at times why our forecast deviates substantially from what we expect.  A second potential problem is that an interest rate path alone may not be sufficient for describing policy over the next several years, given the prominence that balance sheet policies have played.  If instead we are trying to communicate our best forecast for important economic variables, I would prefer to use optimal policy as we do now, even though we might disagree on how we get there.  Of the two, my guess is the general public is primarily interested in our best forecast.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in this passage. The speaker states that they would be opposed to two interpretations of flexible inflation targeting and instead support a quadratic loss function with equal weights on inflation and unemployment. This shows a difference in opinion on the appropriate approach to inflation targeting.


Passage number 62.
  [Laughter] MR. FISHER.  How smart is your brother-in-law.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage as it only includes a statement followed by laughter.


Passage number 63.
 MR. LACKER.  He’s a doctor.  I won’t say anything more.  [Laughter] Price path targeting does a bit better, except for the times when the price level is well below the target path, and then you’d have to do logarithms.  Again, he would call me.  [Laughter]  I think it would be really hard for him to figure out what number to put in that software, and that is a test for simplicity and clarity that I am attracted to. The fourth question:  What should we do.  I found the document we drafted earlier this year compelling.  It explains the relationship between unemployment and inflation—as best we can forge a consensus on it within this group—and does a very good job of embodying that consensus about the relationship.  Recasting that document as an explanation of the Federal Reserve’s flexible inflation-targeting framework seems like an ideal approach.  Using that as a vehicle for slipping into the public domain our commitment to a numerical inflation objective seems to me like the best approach going forward.  Let me leave it at that.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You could tell your brother-in-law what his revenue is going to be in his practice under nominal GDP targeting.  [Laughter] There actually was a good complementarity between your remarks and President Evans’s, and you talked about the uncertainty of the NAIRU over time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing different approaches and ideas, without expressing any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 64.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Lacker simply responds "Yes" to an unknown statement or question from Chairman Bernanke.


Passage number 65.
  President Evans’s approach, if I understood it, was to try to find something that was robust to uncertainty over that particular— MR. LACKER.  Yes, I think robustness has a lot to recommend it.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Both President Evans and Mr. Lacker agree that President Evans's approach of finding something robust to uncertainty is beneficial.


Passage number 66.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, would like to compliment the staff on the fine work they did in advance of the meeting.  I see this discussion of alternative frameworks—and I hope I am not getting ahead of the discussion—as boiling down to two questions.  The first is:  Should the Committee shore up its existing framework to be more effective.  To that, I would answer yes.  The second question is:  In light of the extraordinary circumstances of the economy, should the Committee shake things up, go beyond the existing framework, and go in another direction.  To that question, at the moment at least, I would answer no.  I don’t think the cost-benefit or the risk-reward tradeoffs justify such a move.  I do see that clarification and reaffirmation of the Committee’s basic framework and strategy, and an explicit inflation target, could serve to make the existing and future policy elements more effective.  It will serve to reassure the public that there is coherence to the Committee’s approach and remove some uncertainty at a time when uncertainty is a major negative factor weighing on the economy. Now let me turn to the questions posed by the staff, and I will paraphrase these questions.  Is a flexible inflation-targeting framework consistent with the dual mandate.  Yes, I think flexible inflation targeting, with flexibility around the price-stability mandate, allows for balancing the two objectives in the short term when required while still encompassing the belief that the two mandates are complementary over the longer term. Should we enunciate it as our working framework, perhaps in a way similar to the exit strategy statement.  I think it would be constructive to clarify our working framework in a general sense, and the method used in communication of the exit strategy seems like a reasonable approach.  Also, the consensus-building process that preceded the addendum to the minutes I thought was quite effective.  I also think it would be useful to provide more specifics about certain operational definitions relating to an inflation objective.  We might put more definition around what is meant by short term, medium term, and long term.  For example, we might state that over a long-term horizon of five years or longer, the Committee believes an average year-over-year growth rate of 2 percent, as measured by the overall PCE index, is consistent with the price-stability mandate. We might then state that over a medium-term horizon of three to five years, the Committee seeks to maintain an average year-over-year growth and overall inflation in a range —and this is for example only—of 1 to 3 percent.  This range reflects the intent to keep overall inflation reasonably close to the long-term target while maintaining the flexibility to respond to economic conditions and shocks as required by the other half of the dual mandate.  In the short run—a period of up to three years, and a horizon captured by the Committee’s SEP—the Committee, we might say, aims to closely monitor underlying inflation trends and inflation expectations.  In such a scheme, there is a cascading from explicit long-term objective to performance within a range in the medium term to monitoring underlying inflation expectations in the short term. Should the Committee announce conditional commitments.  If so, how to communicate them.  It is difficult to argue against the principle of credible commitment to an optimal policy path.  That said, I view an explicit threshold for the unemployment rate as potentially problematic.  Our understanding of participation trends, the equilibrium rate of unemployment, the lag in unemployment relative to GDP growth, and any number of other recent labor market developments suggest to me that an explicit threshold for unemployment is risky.  I am also concerned about combining a real-time threshold for unemployment with an inflation threshold based on forecast, because the realization of an unemployment rate result is immediately verifiable, while an inflation forecast is inherently speculative.  I am concerned that the public would interpret such conditionality as a de facto subordination of the inflation objective to an unemployment threshold.  I am more comfortable with the communication method used in paragraph 4′ in this meeting’s proposals, which treats the interest rate, inflation, and unemployment rate conditionality symmetrically—an approach indicating the Committee’s expectations of conditions that will prevail prior to commencing exit.  If the Committee decides to be more activist, I think we need a nominal anchor to reassure the public that we have not lost sight of, and are not jettisoning, the inflation or price-stability objective.  The public wants to know how much tolerance we will admit around the 2 percent inflation objective. What about price-level targeting or nominal income targeting.  Although both of these options have merit, both entail serious communications challenges, as the staff memos have pointed out.  My concern is that a shift to either option, but particularly nominal income targeting, would be viewed as a significant change of the Committee’s approach.  This might introduce more uncertainty about monetary policy and its intent at a time when we should be trying to reduce uncertainty. Finally, a more general question:  What steps should the Committee take to provide more information to the public about the expected course of policy.  I continue to favor inclusion of implied policy paths in the quarterly SEPs.  If the Committee decides to move in the direction of explicit employment and inflation thresholds in the statement, then a more complete rethinking of the SEPs seems necessary.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not have any contention or disagreement. It is the opinion of Mr. Lockhart, who is expressing his views on various questions and topics related to the Committee's framework and strategy.


Passage number 67.
 MR. EVANS.  Could I ask a clarifying question. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Sure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Evans simply asks for permission to ask a clarifying question, and the response is positive.


Passage number 68.
 MR. EVANS.  President Bullard, you often had mentioned the Benhabib–Schmitt-Grohé paper—and I have to admit that the half-life of my understanding of those analyses is usually less than a full meeting length when I ask my staff about that—but I thought that that relied on a Taylor-rule monetary policy, doesn’t it .
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Evans is seeking clarification from President Bullard about the Benhabib-Schmitt-Grohé paper and questioning whether it relies on a Taylor-rule monetary policy.


Passage number 69.
  MR. BULLARD.  The problem in the model is that you’re fully committed to the Taylor-type policy rules.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is a statement made by Mr. Bullard. It does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It simply describes the problem in a model.


Passage number 70.
 MR. EVANS.  But we’ve been running balance sheet policies and we’re also at the zero lower bound, so obviously we’re still running that type of policy.  Isn’t that the kind of thing that would tend to break that equilibrium.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply posing a question for further discussion or consideration.


Passage number 71.
 MR. BULLARD.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It only states "MR. BULLARD" which does not indicate any conflict or differing opinions.


Passage number 72.
  Well, I guess in the memos there is a— MR. EVANS.  I mean, usually there’s some threshold.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 73.
 MR. BULLARD.  —certain type of policy rule.  If that policy rule is going to tell you that you’ll never move off zero until certain conditions are met, then the public starts to think, okay, you’re never going to meet those conditions, so you’re going to stay at zero.  One of the conditions is that inflation is near target, but because of the Fisher relation, inflation expectations are low, and so you’re just permanently below the target.  That’s what happened in Japan, where they’ve had mild deflation for 15 years. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Let me inject here.  I don’t want to get into a deep discussion of this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their thoughts and opinions on a certain policy rule and its potential consequences.


Passage number 74.
 MR. EVANS.  I didn’t want to get into too much. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think, President Bullard, that some of us are confused about the dynamics and the inflation-expectation formation process that supports that equilibrium.  In other words, it’s obviously an equilibrium, but is it one that would naturally occur.  Rather than ask you to answer that here, maybe you could help us with some comments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Evans is expressing his confusion and seeking clarification from President Bullard.


Passage number 75.
 MR. BULLARD.  I can give you a stock answer in one sentence. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating that they have a prepared response that can be summarized in one sentence.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 76.
 MR. BULLARD.  It’s fair to say—I wrote it down in my model—that the one equilibrium is the one that’s the natural one to focus on, but you’ve got a country that’s stuck at the other equilibrium.  Your theory has to tell you why you’re going to be at one equilibrium versus the other. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Maybe because policy wasn’t easy enough in the first place, and they got caught. MS. YELLEN.  Exactly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Bullard suggests that the country is stuck at one equilibrium, while Ms. Yellen agrees with him but also adds that it might be because policy wasn't easy enough in the first place.


Passage number 77.
 MR. BULLARD.  Well, they were at zero.  We’ve been at zero for a long time. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states a fact about the interest rates being at zero for a long time. The statement by President Kocherlakota appears to be unrelated to the previous statement.


Passage number 78.
 MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Successful communication of our policy framework is especially important as we navigate uncharted waters of unconventional policies.  A critical goal of our communication, to me, is to maintain well-anchored inflation expectations.  During the past few years, the anchoring of inflation expectations has paid huge dividends.  It stemmed what could have turned into a sustained deflationary dynamic, and it also provided monetary policy with greater maneuvering room for extraordinary accommodation with less danger of high inflation.  To further reinforce the anchoring of inflation expectations, I strongly favor publicly stating an explicit inflation objective in the context of our dual mandate.  I should say that I am one of the latter participants to go in this round, so many of my further comments are going to echo comments of other participants.  In particular, I noticed that some of my comments are very closely aligned with President Rosengren, and some of my other comments are very closely aligned with President Plosser.  I am not sure how often that sentence is uttered.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It focuses on the importance of successful communication of policy framework and the anchoring of inflation expectations. The speaker also mentions that their comments align with those of other participants.


Passage number 79.
  [Laughter] MR. PLOSSER.  We will watch this with great interest.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply expresses interest in watching something.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 80.
  [Laughter] MR. WILLIAMS.  I, too, think it would be useful to make a general statement of the Committee’s policy framework that we all agree on, and to publish that in the minutes, as was done with the exit strategy.  I actually think flexible inflation targeting is a good framework for thinking about that.  It is a big tent, as many people have already mentioned, but with this group you may need to have a big tent like that, and so that is a good approach.  As President Plosser earlier said, the work that was done by the ad hoc group on putting together a one-pager about the framework around a numerical inflation objective is a good place to start on that.  I will add that inflation targeting has proven to be a very highly successful strategy that has been used in many countries. I do think we have to be careful in how we publicly describe our current policy framework if we were to describe it as flexible inflation targeting.  The problem, which has already been mentioned by a number of people—and this is where President Rosengren’s comments and mine overlap—is that flexible inflation targeting is a very elastic term.  It means different things to different people.  For example, some inflation-targeting central banks have a hierarchical mandate in which price stability is the prime goal.  That is not how I interpret our dual mandate or our framework.  Explicitly identifying ourselves as an inflexible inflation targeter could be misperceived as tipping the balance of our dual mandate strongly toward price stability.  This could complicate already daunting communications challenges, and it could be seen as inconsistent with the mandate given to us by Congress.  If we were to publicly describe our framework as flexible inflation targeting, which I do support in principle, it is important that we do so along the lines that Lars Svensson has done, and that is as a balanced approach, with a significant weight on both parts of the dual mandate. With regard to communicating the optimal policy under commitment, such an approach is attractive for the reasons that were laid out in the staff memos.  Unfortunately, for similar reasons that President Bullard mentioned, I think it is an unrealistic benchmark.  In the jargon of academics, our commitment technology is very limited.  It is simply impossible for us to set a predetermined course of policy that will bind future Committees.  Another comment I will make on the staff presentations, which were really helpful, is that the differences in the outcomes under the different policies that they look at—nominal income targeting or inertial Taylor rule or optimal policy—depend critically on the expectations of events that are many years in the future, another point that President Bullard and others have made.  For example, if you look at exhibit 2 from Mike Kiley’s presentation, it is striking that the inertial Taylor rule and the nominal income-targeting rules actually yield essentially the same unemployment paths, as I see it, up until 2017, yet the inflation rates starting from 2012 are very different.  I have dabbled in the dark arts of large-scale macro models, so I have some understanding of how these models work.  Events way out in the future can really feed back into the present in a very strong way, and there is a lot of uncertainty about how strong the feedback effects are of events five, six, seven years in the future on the actual inflation and unemployment rates today.  I am not sure if, in reality, the simulations may exaggerate the benefits of differences in policy regimes.  As President Bullard said, these simulations assume rational expectations, and that everybody instantly knows the change in the policy regime.  In practice, I think there would be some learning and adjustment that would again reduce the differences in the policy alternatives. Instead of thinking of optimal control as being the approach that we should be concentrating on, we should aim to communicate as clearly as possible our current reaction function.  Policy thresholds could help in this communication.  Alternatively, as Governor Tarullo and I argued last time, and a number of participants have already mentioned, we could include our individual projections about the appropriate path of monetary policy in the published SEP.  Then, as our forecasts for economic activity, inflation, and the funds rate evolve, the public would get a clear picture of the state-contingent nature of our policy reaction function.  Although I have not yet studied the results that we were sent this weekend from the trial run of the SEP, my reading of the SEP answers is that these are consistent with what I think of as a pretty clear view of where policy is expected to evolve, with a liftoff apparently in early 2014 or so, with a range of views on that.  That range of views in the SEP about when liftoff is and what the policy will look like going forward is consistent with the range of views on inflation and economic activity.  That would benefit transparency, and it would be consistent with our policy framework and communication. Finally, I don’t believe this is now the time to switch to a price-level or nominal income target.  In theory, these approaches can work very well.  President Lacker, and I think President Kocherlakota, brought up the issue that you should be really evaluating policy frameworks in an unconditional stance, thinking about how they perform on average.  I and many other people have actually looked at that issue in different models and under different assumptions.  The way I would summarize is that a very good monetary policy rule—a well-calibrated Taylor rule, or an optimal control policy, or a nominal income-targeting policy, or a flexible price-level targeting policy—all of these do really well if they are well designed.  They do roughly equivalently well in normal conditions.  Looking at that question doesn’t give you an answer about which framework you want.  You really do have to think about the communications issues and also the unusual circumstances that we are in today.  At this time, switching horses in the middle of the stream could confuse more than clarify, and ultimately could backfire.  In particular, nominal income targeting seems to muddy the waters.  Investors care separately about prices and about quantities.  And, importantly, we care separately about prices and about quantities.  Looking at only nominal income, which mashes together prices and quantities, seems to me at this time to be counterproductive and could undermine the anchoring of inflation expectations.  Thanks. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. The speaker supports flexible inflation targeting but is cautious about publicly describing the framework as such because it could be misperceived as tipping the balance strongly towards price stability and inconsistent with the dual mandate given by Congress. The speaker also disagrees with the idea of switching to a price-level or nominal income target at this time, as it could confuse more than clarify and undermine the anchoring of inflation expectations.


Passage number 81.
 MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, I am going to start and conclude where President Williams concluded.  That is, I don’t think now is the time, but I do think it is a subject we are studying. First, I want to thank the staff for their good work.  I also want to thank them for their honesty.  I thought section 4 about the risks of our models at least, and the faulty potential of our models, was frank and honest.  I do want to have submitted for the record a particularly pungent sentence, which says, “Given that the strategies we consider lack historical precedent, and even the tools used to implement the strategies are relatively unconventional, there is considerable risk that our model results may prove faulty in some respect.”  Indeed, any policy outside the range of historical experience, ranging from the strategies considered here to balance sheet adjustments and macroprudential regulation, could have unintended consequences for economic welfare, for better or for worse.  Your section 4 expands upon that somewhat.  I thank you for the good work that you have put together. I am in favor of at least more discipline, if not a rule.  I think we have been a little bit spastic in the way we have developed policy, a little bit reactionary, and we have sent signals to the marketplace, which then seem to be built into expectations.  I would like to see a little bit more discipline as we go through time. I am in favor of the exercise.  I boil it down to two simple principles:  We have to be realistic, and we have to be credible.  What I mean by realistic is that we know that we have more influence on inflation as a monetary phenomenon than we do on employment.  What I mean by credible is that shifting horses, whether we do it midstream or whenever we do it, cannot be viewed as a weakening of our commitment to price stability, and cannot be viewed as, in particular, a weakening of our commitment to long-term price stability. I thought President George’s comments were interesting.  To me, the key variable is to identify a longer-term inflation target.  I am in favor of doing that.  President George pointed out some issues around that—which target do we pick, under what conditions, and so on—but talking about having one is a worthwhile exercise. Then, I would want to understand better within this Committee what the bands of tolerance are around that target if we are going to talk about flexible inflation targeting.  Once we have achieved that understanding, then I think we need to explain to the public that as long as we have a dual mandate we have to deal with both inflation and unemployment variables.  And as long as we have that mandate, then it may be desirable, if we decide that is the case at this table—once we have agreed on a long-term inflation target, and our tolerance bands around it—that we may have to deviate occasionally from our target on maybe the high or the low side in order to deal with our employment mandate. This is something that we should take some time to consider.  I started this meeting by giving President Bullard a six-pack of Shiner Bock beer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their thanks to the staff and their support for more discipline and a realistic and credible approach to monetary policy. They also agree with the idea of setting a longer-term inflation target and discussing the potential need to deviate from that target to address employment issues.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 82.
 MR. BULLARD.  Three left.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage suggests that there are three people remaining or three items remaining, but it is not clear what specifically is left, which could create confusion or disagreement.


Passage number 83.
 MR. FISHER.  There are only two left, actually.  [Laughter]  Shiner Bock beer, by the way, Mr. Chairman, was picked because the Shiner brewery was founded in 1913, fitting for the Federal Reserve.  But if you look at the way beer is made, out of hops and grains, the standard formula has been in place since the year 1541 under a ruler of Bavaria named Henry IV.  Now, there have been improvements made to beer, but I think it is something that you would have to proceed with extremely slowly. I am not suggesting we take another 500-and-some-odd years to change our rule or our discipline, but I do think that we need to vet the thoughts that have been circling around this table.  Reference has been made to Ms. Romer.  I thought that was an interesting article.  However, I must tell you that all I got out of it was, “Be bold.”  That was what her message was.  I wasn’t convinced by her argumentation.  I have listened very carefully to Ken Rogoff, who is on our advisory committee at the Dallas Fed and our Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute.  I respect him enormously.  And then, I observed the pushback that came from another person I respect enormously named Paul Volcker.  I understand that Tobin made the arguments in the 1970s, but I also understand that no other central bank has attempted what we are talking about.  You had a slight variation of price-level targeting in 1930 by the Swedes.  We love to evoke the Scandinavians at this table.  But it was not held for very long, and it was a variation of price-level targeting.  To my knowledge, no central bank has adopted nominal income targeting.  It is true that Tobin made the argument in 1970.  It is true that Martin Feldstein agreed with it. I did have Professor Feldstein down the other day to the Dallas Fed.  He is completely against it presently.  Why.  Because he doesn’t think we are quite credible yet in having anchored—and this is his own personal view—our commitment to long-term price stability.  I come back to long-term price stability.  To me, that is the key variable.  The flexibility around it is something that we need to define, and then we need to socialize it.  Despite the interest that has been shown by Goldman Sachs and Christy Romer and others, I think we need to socialize it further.  I would say at a minimum I would take the theoretical work that has been done, and some of the studies that we are doing, and at least get these out into academia and into a more serious discussion, so that we can evaluate these alternative policy rules and see what kind of criticisms come forward. Mr. Chairman, in short, I am in favor of trying to achieve greater discipline.  I would like to come up with a rule that is more modernized.  I am willing to change the formula to the beer that we brew, but we should take our time.  I would like to suggest that we look at a time horizon that doesn’t have to be infinite.  I would be against changing this horse in midstream now, as President Williams mentioned.  But I would at least like to have these questions discussed and vetted and thought through—including the risks that I mentioned at the very beginning—over the course of the next several months, if not half a year.  I think it is a worthwhile exercise.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It is primarily a statement of the speaker's own opinions and thoughts on the topic at hand.


Passage number 84.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll begin where Esther began, with the observation that people’s preferences with respect to things we call framework or quasi-constitutional changes are almost always connected to substantive policy preferences.  I very much think that’s the case here, and so in part that leads me to want to bypass a lot of this discussion in order to focus on the question of what should we be doing given the fact that we have somewhat differing analyses of where the economy is.  I think that leads to more need for communication, but it pushes me away from a preference for structural or quasi-constitutional changes because of my observation that writing constitutions or frameworks tends to become more complicated precisely because there’s a different set of debates going on underneath, which are substantive policy debates.  And, while I wouldn’t foreclose any of that, having listened to most of the conversation already today, it doesn’t strike me that there’s been an enormous amount of convergence thus far around any new framework. The second introductory observation I’d make is that the more I’ve read in the intermeeting period about the way other central banks do everything, do inflation targeting and economic projections and the monetary policymaking in general, the more I have been impressed with the—how shall I put this neutrally.—peculiarity of the Federal Reserve System.  Thus the tentative conclusion that much of what may work in other countries, in other monetary policy committees in other systems, may not work particularly well precisely because of the different institutional characteristics that the Federal Reserve System has. Turning to the questions that the staff put in front of us, I’m going to change the order somewhat and start with the framework question.  To Richard, I would say that the possibility of unanticipated negative consequences is a sobering one to be sure, but one always has to balance that with what the costs of the status quo are, and that’s where we get to substantive issues again.  My own view, which won’t come as a surprise to anyone, is I am deeply distressed with the status quo.  I fear, as an increasing number of people do, that we are sliding into a period of stagnation, which will become ever more difficult to extract ourselves from.  As an ex ante matter, I wouldn’t dismiss something just because there probably will be negative unanticipated consequences.  However, I think Janet and a number of others have pointed to anticipated negative consequences, which could be associated with some of the framework changes, and add to that the communications difficulties that a number of you have pointed out, and it seems to me—again, like many, though not everybody here—that these things are worthy of continual consideration in the event that the economy deteriorates further or, regrettably more likely perhaps today than a few days ago, we get a major external shock sometime in the not-too-distant future. I’m going to pair the threshold proposal with the SEP because I think they are both about communications.  As everybody knows from the last meeting, John and I were trying to push forward onto the table the use of the modified SEP as a surrogate for the use of the thresholds, and I continue to think that bears consideration, but I’m going to place two qualifications on my own predisposition. First, I read the results of our initial foray here as posing more of a communication problem than I had anticipated, and I am of the provisional conclusion that aggregating the 17 individual results is not going to do the trick.  We may want to think about some alternatives, again, taking into account the peculiar institutional characteristics of the Fed for this purpose, the fact that we are a very large group compared with other central banks that have this kind of exercise.  The academics with whom I’ve spoken about these sorts of exercises all point to the value of the discussion whereby the monetary policy committee critiques, and comes eventually to some consensus, on the projected path of interest rates.  I have a vivid imagination, but I have had difficulty conjuring up the scenario in which the 17 people around this table come to a consensus view on a projected path of interest rates.  But it seems at least plausible that if staff could construct three scenarios—one, relatively higher inflation; two, their baseline scenario; three, relatively lower inflation—we might have the opportunity to get most members of the Committee signing onto the proposition that if this, in fact, is the way that the economy evolves over the next eight quarters or whatever the projection period would be, then the anticipated federal funds rate path associated with that movement in the economy would be appropriate.  I don’t know if that’s possible either, but it seems to me worth thinking about. The second problem, which somebody alluded to earlier, and I did note this in my memo last time, is that at present we’ve got the big balance sheet in addition to the zero interest rates.  As many of us have said many times, beginning to draw down the balance sheet would be the equivalent of a tightening move and thus would be relevant to market actors and somehow that would be need to be factored in. Moving now to the flexible inflation approach, Jeff is absolutely right.  You state the proposition broadly enough, everybody can agree with it, and that allows everybody to tweak the particular clauses or phrases in the formulation in order to make it fit their policy predisposition.  As I’ve said before on this Committee, I was substantially more open-minded on stating an explicit inflation target when I walked in here two years and nine months ago than I am now, and the reason for that gets back to Esther’s observation.  I think to a considerable extent, it reflects, and would be perceived publicly as reflecting, a fairly strong, substantive preference for an inflation target over the other side of the dual mandate. I have listened to some of us around the table who basically say that if you do price stability well, you will promote maximum employment, which to me is very close to reading half the dual mandate out of the statute.  It is a coherent view of the world, but it’s not either what the statute says or my view of the world, and thus I have some substantial resistance to it.  There are some environments in which the establishment of an explicit inflation target, along with the kind of explanations of unemployment or maximum employment or output gaps that people have mentioned, could be perceived as a balanced embodiment of the dual mandate.  I don’t think that this is one of them.  Although I’m not closed-minded on the proposition, I have to say that there’s a substantial hurdle that I feel has to be overcome before I would be comfortable with it. My last comment would be that one way to potentially make me comfortable with an inflation target—contrary to what Esther said, as opposed to agreeing with her—is if it were put in place as part of an exercise that was actually accommodative.  That is, if the inflation target were put in place and the rest of the explanation of the dual mandate made an effort to communicate as clearly and credibly as we could a medium-term inflation target, while at the same time taking the kind of substantive policy accommodation steps which I think are needed, then it would be a different story.  But as Esther’s comment reflects and as I’ve heard others speak, it seems to me that a lot of people want actually to pull those apart because, quite legitimately, they have a substantive policy preference for not taking further accommodative action and, thus, don’t want to tie those two things together.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Raskin.  I’m sorry.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 85.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you.  I have two questions.  Brian, as this chart shows, we’ve been buying a lot more nominals than TIPS, and under the same theory that lengthening our maturity of our portfolio twists the curve, that would also affect the breakeven spreads.  Do you think that’s happening.  And do you have a quantitative estimate of how much.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is simply a question being asked by Mr. Lacker.


Passage number 86.
 MR. SACK.  It could be happening.  We don’t have a good quantitative estimate.  The reason we include TIPS is we don’t want to distort the decomposition of nominal rates into their breakeven and real components.  We want to have some presence in that market, and, of course, when we calibrate the pace of purchases or the allocation of our purchases, we look at a variety of measures to try to judge how much we could buy without causing market strains. Here I’m showing gross public issuance.  When you compare it to gross issuance, it looks quite small, but I think we did have some concerns that going too fast could disrupt the markets, since this is a less liquid market anyway and there are a lot of buy-and-hold investors.  Having said all that, it’s possible we undershot, and indeed there were some commentaries by market participants, such as Barclay’s, talking about our programs actually putting downward pressure on breakeven inflation rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing information and discussing the reasons for including TIPS in their purchases, as well as potential concerns and commentary from market participants.


Passage number 87.
 MR. LACKER.  You gave us an estimate of the effect on the 10-year yield, but it would be nice to have an estimate of this as well. The second question is about Treasury debt issuance plans.  Is there anything you can tell us about what you know about their plans for next year and the extent to which they may be contemplating or may have embarked on a path that would to some extent offset what we’ve done.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Lacker is simply asking for more information and clarification on the 10-year yield effect and Treasury debt issuance plans.


Passage number 88.
 MR. SACK.  I believe they have not made debt management decisions in response to the effects of our program that would undo our program.  They are certainly not looking at rates and opportunistically saying, “Given what the Fed has done to the yield curve, we want to move further out in our issuance.”  Having said that, they were already on a course that was lengthening the average duration of their issuance, and I think that lengthening will continue over the near term.  At one of the recent meetings, we talked about Treasury expecting to be on a path toward a weighted-average maturity of about 70 months, the market having anticipated that, and I think the discussion at Treasury essentially is not whether to go beyond 70, but whether to stop at 70 or stop somewhat below that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating their belief and providing an explanation for why they hold that belief.


Passage number 89.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  It’s fair to say that we don’t think Treasury has adjusted their behavior in response to our behavior.  It sounds like that’s the key point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement expressed in this statement. The speaker simply states that the behavior of the Treasury has not changed in response to their own behavior, without suggesting any disagreement or opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 90.
 MR. SACK.  They’re also considering a debt management innovation that would probably reduce the amount of duration that they issue.  They’ve asked the TBAC to consider the appeal of floating-rate securities, which of course would allow the Treasury to reduce rollover risk while not introducing duration into the market.  If that were a product that they brought on line and used in any size, that would actually help in terms of keeping duration out of the market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It presents a potential debt management innovation and discusses its potential benefits without introducing any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 91.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage consists of a statement and a response, without any indication of disagreement or argument.


Passage number 92.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have a quick question, Brian.  In terms of table 18, what would Goldman Sachs look like if we looked at their liability structure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking a question for clarification.


Passage number 93.
 MR. SACK.  I initially had Goldman Sachs on the table.  I am contemplating whether to dig through my notes.  It looks a lot like Morgan Stanley.  I can send you the details.  The point is, both Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs look different from institutions with larger banking operations in the sense that they both have some retail deposits but much less in the banking operation, and hence they rely more intensively on repo financing.  The point of this table is to say that was true for MF Global as well, but of course to a much more extreme degree.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating the author's observations and analysis of the similarities between Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs in terms of their banking operations and reliance on repo financing.


Passage number 94.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  So, long-term unsecured debt would look roughly the same, you think, for Goldman Sachs in terms of percentage.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is asking for confirmation or agreement regarding the statement being made.


Passage number 95.
 MR. SACK.  I think it would be in the same ballpark now that the figures show.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Sack is expressing his opinion about something.


Passage number 96.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information that would indicate contention or disagreement. It is simply expressing gratitude.


Passage number 97.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Deposits would probably be a little less.  Their bank is probably a little smaller.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The words "little less" and "little smaller" indicate a minor decrease or difference without any conflicting statements or opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 98.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thanks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The speaker is expressing gratitude or acknowledgement, there is no expression of contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 99.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I’m sorry.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The use of the word "sorry" suggests a disagreement or interruption in the conversation, indicating some form of contention.


Passage number 100.
 MR. PLOSSER.  I want to follow up with a question that Brian may not be able to answer, but I’m just curious.  If I looked at JPMorgan three years ago, before the crisis, roughly what percentage would they have had in repo and trading liabilities—just ballpark.  Twice this or 50 percent more or about the same.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing curiosity and asking a question about JPMorgan's percentage of repo and trading liabilities before the crisis.


Passage number 101.
 MR. SACK.  I will have to check on that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. Mr. Sack simply states that he needs to verify something.


Passage number 102.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I would guess more, because remember, they bought Washington Mutual, which had a lot of core deposits.  The repo books have generally come down over the past couple of years.  I would guess more, but I don’t think it’s so significant that you’d think they were in a very different position.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply voicing their opinion and making an educated guess about a situation.


Passage number 103.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Okay.  That’s kind of where I was. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  Let me go to President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no disagreement or contention in this passage. Mr. Plosser is simply expressing his understanding and agreement with a previous statement.


Passage number 104.
 MR. FISHER.  First, I want to congratulate you on handling MF Global the way you handled it.  I have a question about that, and I have two other questions.  But on this front, any other trip bars that might ensue from MF’s failure that you’re monitoring in terms of its impact on the system—not the Federal Reserve System, but on the fixed-income markets and on financial stability.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any disagreement or contention. It simply states that the speaker congratulates someone on their handling of an issue and then proceeds to ask questions about the impact of that issue on different aspects of the financial system.


Passage number 105.
 MR. SACK.  Yes, there are several areas we’re monitoring.  MF Global, of course, had essentially a large brokerage unit into futures markets.  One area we’re watching is whether their customers will experience any period of disruption and confusion about their ability to change positions.  There could potentially be odd short-term dynamics for futures markets. The second area is questions about whether the customers’ assets are truly fully there at the institution, and if there were problems in that regard, you could see a loss in confidence in other types of custodial arrangements or intermediaries. And the third area is whether there would be any consequences for repo financing, not necessarily direct consequences associated with the unwinding of MF Global’s positions, but broader concerns about whether repo funding for less liquid assets is as stable as the market had assumed. I’m sure there are others, but those are three areas that we’re watching.  Not having the benefit of seeing markets today, but through yesterday, it looked like the markets were not overly concerned with any of those systemic consequences, but that’s what we’ll continue to monitor. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman, you wanted to add to that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply discussing areas that they are monitoring and expressing potential concerns without any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 106.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes, just a few things.  This is the first significantly sized FCM, futures commission merchant, that’s failed in a way that they didn’t actually port the customer accounts off smoothly to some other entity.  There’s a little bit more uncertainty here because it has never happened like this before.  In the past, there has always been a smooth transfer of accounts. The second thing I would say is that it underscores how fast liquidity can dry up for a firm.  This is another firm that, while I wouldn’t say they were fine a week ago, they didn’t look like they were headed to collapse, and a week later they’re dead.  That is going to reinforce people’s anxiety about firms that are wholesale funded without any obvious lender-of-last-resort support from the central bank.  I think as long as other firms stay out of trouble, it’s not an issue, but if they get into trouble, people may actually pull back faster as a consequence. And the third thing, of course, is that this was triggered in part by, as Brian mentioned, European sovereign debt exposure.  To the extent that things in Europe deteriorate, other firms are viewed as having exposure to Europe, and that’s another aspect of this.  But so far we would say, and I think Brian and I would both agree, that the selloff in the market today really has very little to do with MF Global.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their opinion and observations.


Passage number 107.
 MR. FISHER.  I would add a fourth factor, which is humility versus arrogance and balanced risk.  The principals involved here were extremely arrogant, taking the positions that they had, and were imbalanced in terms of their judiciousness of risks, and I think the markets are well aware of that. The second area of inquiry I have, Brian, if you look at your chart 1 and chart 8, is with regard to the way Treasuries have moved and the initial way that corporate bond spreads moved—remember those spreads are relative to an increase in the yields as shown in chart 1.  Can you separate out for me the Operation Twist impact versus the impact of Europe in terms of influencing the way yields have moved.  The question really deals with the efficacy of Operation Twist—and mind you, we’re just starting this process—and trying to separate out the seesaw effect and the whipsaw effect of what’s happening in Europe.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 108.
 MR. SACK.  Are you specifically raising the question of whether Operation Twist passed through to the private borrowing rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple question asking if the issue of Operation Twist passing through to private borrowing rates is being discussed.


Passage number 109.
  Or do you— MR. FISHER.  What I care about is whether it passed through to private borrowing rates.  That’s my priority—how it impacts the market for private debt.  Because chart 1 doesn’t indicate what one might have expected, but I care more about what happens in terms of private debt.  That should be our objective—affecting the real economy.  I am curious as to your judgment at this stage, and mind you, it is initial.  And then, how are you able to separate out the seesaw effect we have gotten from the standpoint of enthusiasm over Europe and then sudden disappointment on the details.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their priority and concern for the impact on private borrowing rates and the real economy. They also express curiosity about the judgment and ability to separate out certain effects. However, there is no direct disagreement or contention present.


Passage number 110.
 MR. SACK.  My assessment would be that Operation Twist put downward pressure on Treasury yields, as I said in the briefing.  All else being equal, the majority of that would have passed through to private borrowing rates—maybe not the entirety of it, but the large majority of it. What actually happened on the FOMC announcement was that private borrowing rates did not go down for lower-quality issuers, that spreads widened immediately.  But I would interpret that spread widening as more of a reaction to the concerns about the economy and the pessimism that was in the FOMC statement that apparently surprised market participants, rather than a lack of pass-through from the Twist action itself.   It wasn’t that Twist only affects Treasuries and nothing else.  We do think that arbitrage, all else being equal, would have pulled down the private borrowing rates.  You see that in the reaction of the 30-year swap rate.  The 30-year swap rate, in terms of credit risk, is somewhat complicated.  It does have a credit risk premium in it related to the LIBOR that it is referenced to.  It is not the credit risk of lending to a firm for 30 years, but it is essentially the credit risk of promising to lend to a bank that will be in the LIBOR panel for those 30 years.  That means it has a much smaller credit risk component than corporate yields.  You can look at this and basically, from the relative movement of swaps and Treasuries, assess whether Treasury yield movements pass through to private rates, all else being equal, and then add on top of that the effects on credit quality. In terms of assessed credit quality, for sure it has been a seesaw.  The market repriced to much wider credit spreads through early October associated with pessimism about the economy and concerns about risks emanating from Europe.  It is the same pattern we saw with the financials and their CDS spreads, and so on.  Then, as sentiment improved—which was the old theme of the briefing, as Europe seemed a little better and the data came in—that is really what led to a substantial narrowing of the corporate bond spreads.  But my guess is, as we seesaw here, if this pessimism we have seen in the past two days persists, we will again start to see some upward pressure on corporate yield spreads.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage discusses the effects of Operation Twist on Treasury yields and private borrowing rates. While there is some discussion of differing reactions and assessments of the situation, there is no explicit contention or disagreement between the parties involved.


Passage number 111.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you.  And then, one last quick question.  Do we know why the Norwegians liquidated their MBS portfolio entirely on Friday.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a question about the reason behind the Norwegians liquidating their MBS portfolio.


Passage number 112.
 MR. SACK.  No, I don’t.  We didn’t run down that story.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Sack simply states that he does not have information about a specific story.


Passage number 113.
 MR. FISHER.  It might be interesting to get as much as we can.  They are running a $500 billion plus sovereign fund.  They do interact with the central bank.  I haven’t seen an explanation yet as to why they would liquidate their entire MBS portfolio.  If you can just follow up, I would be very grateful.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply expresses curiosity and a desire for more information.


Passage number 114.
 MR. SACK.  Yes, that would be very easy for us to ask about.  We just haven’t done it yet.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states that asking about something would be easy for them, but they haven't done it yet.


Passage number 115.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. Mr. Fisher is expressing gratitude and there is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 116.
 MR. EVANS.  I thought you spoke Norwegian.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no indication of contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply shows Mr. Evans expressing his thought about the other person speaking Norwegian.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 117.
   MR. FISHER.  They didn’t explain it in Norwegian or English.  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Duke. MS. DUKE.  My question goes back to the impact on customers of MF Global, and this question may not make sense because I wasn’t sure I understood the article I read just before I came in here.  But it was something about either clearinghouses or exchanges freezing customer transactions, customers of MF.  And then, I was remembering how some of the people who came through here were really unhappy in the Lehman bankruptcy about their collateral getting tied up in pieces.  Is there anything in moving derivatives to central counterparties that we should be aware of in connection with this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement or contention in the following passage. 

In this passage, Governor Duke expresses uncertainty and confusion about an article she read regarding the freezing of customer transactions in clearinghouses or exchanges related to MF Global. Her statement about not understanding the article and seeking clarification suggests a disagreement or contention over the impact on customers and potential risks involved in moving derivatives to central counterparties.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 118.
 MR. SACK.  That is related to one of the three broad concerns I talked about:  Would there be uncertainty about the client’s ability to change positions.  Would there be confusion about what the status of their assets was or not.  And as Vice Chairman Dudley mentioned, without the quick transfer of the client accounts, it leaves this uncertainty.  I don’t know enough about the legal arrangements to answer the questions you raise.  But how long that will take and how transparent it will be in terms of when the customers will be able to reaccess their positions is one of the big areas of uncertainty here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is a contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Sack, states that he does not know enough about the legal arrangements to answer the questions raised by the other party. This implies a disagreement or lack of agreement on the issue at hand.


Passage number 119.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  SIPC is on the case now as a trustee, so they are trying to manage these accounts.  But I think there is definitely some freezing of assets and people not being able to execute this stuff.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 120.
 MR. TARULLO.  It’s CFTC rules, though, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not show any indication of contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement acknowledging that the rules being discussed belong to the CFTC.


Passage number 121.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  FTC rules on it for the FCM.  And they were not a big firm, about $40 billion or $45 billion in assets, but they were very big in the commodities space. MS. DUKE.  Is there anything in that that would cause potential customers of, say, Morgan Stanley not to want to be customers of Morgan Stanley for just that reason.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage simply provides information about the FTC rules and Morgan Stanley's size in the commodities space. It then poses a question about whether those factors would deter potential customers from doing business with Morgan Stanley.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 122.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I think this is probably viewed as a pretty idiosyncratic case.  But, like I said before—wholesale funding model, dependence on repo, exposure to Europe—our base case is that the contagion channel should be small, but there is some risk.  Brian, would you agree with that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker believes that the contagion risk is small but acknowledges that there is some risk involved. The mention of asking Brian if he agrees suggests that there may be differing opinions or perspectives on the matter.


Passage number 123.
 MR. SACK.  Right, exactly.  You have these relationships not only at FCMs but also through prime brokers, and so on.  When we saw some of the pressure on the financials, such as Morgan Stanley, through early October, there was a lot of focus on the prime-brokerage relationships.  We talked to some hedge funds who were actually trying to figure out how to hedge those exposures, so generally, that is a piece of the story about stress at any institution.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 124.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  If you feel we are going in the right direction rather than seeming to go in the wrong direction in terms of market sentiment, you would probably be less nervous about this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not present any disagreement or contention. It is a conditional statement discussing how feeling positive about the market direction would result in less nervousness.


Passage number 125.
 MR. TARULLO.  But, Bill, when you said it was idiosyncratic, did you mean idiosyncratic to the underlying problems at MF Global.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The person clarifies what the other person meant by using the term "idiosyncratic."


Passage number 126.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation:
Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. However, since the passage is not provided, it is not possible to determine the exact nature of the contention or disagreement.


Passage number 127.
  MR. TARULLO.  But in answer to Betsy’s question, were another firm that was a commodities merchant to get in trouble, there is no reason to expect that the exchange treatment of collateral would be different for them than it was in this case, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

In the given passage, there is no contention or disagreement. Mr. Tarullo is simply providing an answer to Betsy's question and stating that there would be no reason to expect a different treatment of collateral for another firm in trouble.


Passage number 128.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  What was unusual in this case was the fact that in the segregation of the customer accounts there was a shortfall, and that is gumming up the works, in a different way than you would expect in a normal case.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is describing a unique situation where there is an unusual problem with the segregation of customer accounts. There is no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 129.
 MR. TARULLO.  Are those the same accounts, or was the action on the Chicago Mercantile independent of the private customers’ accounts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a simple question asking for clarification about the relationship between different accounts.


Passage number 130.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I don’t know.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage.


Passage number 131.
 I think there was a press report about the CME saying that they were aware of problems with the customer— MR. TARULLO.  So maybe it is related.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is merely providing information about a press report and a potential relationship between the CME and a customer. There is no contention or disagreement presented.


Passage number 132.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  —segregated assets, but I don’t have any details on that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 133.
 MR. TARULLO.  If it is related, then it is purely idiosyncratic.  If it’s not related, then it gets to the way they conduct themselves. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It simply presents a statement made by Mr. Tarullo about the topic at hand.


Passage number 134.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Just to continue on the question of MF Global, a couple of weeks ago, as you see on chart 12, there was—and I hesitate to call it a “run” —but certainly a lot of pressure on Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which has eased.  Then, we get the first casualty with MF Global.  My broad question, Brian, is:  Are you more or less concerned about financial instability now than two weeks ago.  How is that trending.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of events and a question about the speaker's level of concern.


Passage number 135.
 MR. SACK.  At best slightly more comfortable, but actually probably about the same.  As I noted, what happened a few weeks ago with Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs was the same dynamic.  Taking Morgan Stanley as an example, based on their discussions about the firm’s exposures, I think market participants weren’t convinced that the firm actually had problematic exposures, but what they were convinced about was the fact that if the market got too concerned, they could put Morgan Stanley out of business because of their reliance on short-term funding markets.  I think that contributed a lot to the jitters that emerged in early October, and it is the same dynamic that ultimately brought down MF Global.  But I do want to emphasize that MF Global is a very different case than a Morgan Stanley, in terms of the aggressiveness—relative to its size—of how MF Global was positioned.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing his analysis and perspective on the situations involving Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and MF Global.


Passage number 136.
 MR. LOCKHART.  But their reliance on short-term funding is a lot different, too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply pointing out that there is a difference in the reliance on short-term funding compared to something else.


Passage number 137.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes.  Morgan Stanley, we believe, has a very large liquidity cushion.  The MF Global experience showed you that whatever liquidity cushion you have can run off a lot faster than you expect.  Morgan Stanley is starting with a much better balance sheet than MF Global was, and they have been actually earning money.  One of the precipitating events for MF Global was that they took a very large loss in the most recent quarter.  That was really what started this thing spinning last Tuesday.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is providing an analysis and comparison of the liquidity cushions and balance sheets of Morgan Stanley and MF Global.


Passage number 138.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Do you see any dynamic of predatory market players essentially gaining any victory with this one and moving on to the next most vulnerable.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 139.
   MR. SACK.  No.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply providing a response without any conflicting ideas or opinions.


Passage number 140.
 MR. LOCKHART.  No, we don’t see anything like that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage "No, we don't see anything like that" indicates a lack of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 141.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I don’t think this was about people shorting the CDS and driving down the stock price.  This is all about the fundamentals of the company; that would be my opinion. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I’ve got President Bullard and President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their personal opinion about the situation without contradicting anyone else's perspective.


Passage number 142.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  On MF Global—it became a primary dealer this year, is that correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions a fact about MF Global becoming a primary dealer.


Passage number 143.
 MR. SACK.  Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple response or confirmation by Mr. Sack.


Passage number 144.
 MR. BULLARD.  Are we happy with our expanded criteria for primary dealers.  And does this give you any pause about that new, more expansive definition.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Bullard is asking a direct question about the expanded criteria for primary dealers and whether it raises any concerns for the new definition.


Passage number 145.
 MR. SACK.  The new primary dealer policy just increases the transparency about the requirements.  There was no reduction in the requirements to be a primary dealer.  When we look at the primary dealers as candidates, there is an extensive review.  It covers quality of management, the quality of their systems, their financial health, and so on.  But we are at a disadvantage.  We are not a supervisor of this firm.  There is a credit review.  They passed the credit review.  But that doesn’t guarantee that they can’t go downhill.  As we see in the market price and everything, they went downhill very quickly and very unexpectedly. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is informative and does not present any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 146.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes, a question about MF Global, and then I want to follow up on a question from President Fisher.  MF Global is insolvent, I take it.  Is that our best information.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It is a simple question being posed to gather information.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 147.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I don’t think we know whether they are insolvent or not.  We know they can’t meet their obligations, but that doesn’t mean when they are all liquidated that the value of the assets couldn’t be a lot greater than the value of the liabilities.  We don’t know that.  The fact is that their long-term debt, which they have a small piece of, is trading at about, last time I saw, in the 35 to 45 percent per dollar range, which suggests that the market thinks that they are most likely to be insolvent.  But we are not going to know for a while.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker states that they don't know whether the subject is insolvent or not, while also presenting evidence and market perception that suggests the subject is likely to be insolvent. This contradiction creates contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 148.
 MR. LACKER.  Okay.  Do you view how it has played out as inefficient ex post.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 149.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  It was inefficient in the sense that there was not an orderly bankruptcy process.  It would be much better if there had been a way to move the customer accounts to new firms, so that they didn’t get trapped.  It was messier than optimal.  Is it systemic or not.  Fingers crossed, we hope not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply describes the inefficiency and messiness of a situation without any conflicting viewpoints or perspectives. Therefore, it is not systemic.


Passage number 150.
 MR. LACKER.  About Richard Fisher’s question about corporate debt spreads—this actually came up at the last meeting.  We are operating under this habitat theory, and there is this question:  Is 10-year corporate debt in the same habitat as 10-year Treasuries.  Or is it in a separate habitat, and its yield doesn’t move.  And the data look like it is in a separate habitat, but you are saying that there was some offsetting move and some expectation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a statement about a discussion that took place at a meeting.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 151.
 MR. SACK.  Right, that’s what I’m saying.  Equity prices went down sharply on the FOMC announcement.  If the story were just a preferred habitat, so that Operation Twist only affected Treasuries and didn’t affect corporates and that explained the widening of spreads, that alone wouldn’t cause a big decline in equity prices.  Clearly the market read the FOMC statement as more pessimistic than expected and repriced equities and corporate bonds accordingly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Sack, suggests that the decline in equity prices was not solely due to the preferred habitat theory and the widening of spreads, but rather it was because the market read the FOMC statement as more pessimistic than expected. This implies that there is disagreement about the cause of the decline in equity prices.


Passage number 152.
 MR. LACKER.  The question I want to ask is about 2-year versus 10-year corporates.  Do you view the impediments between those two markets as similar to the impediments between 2-year Treasuries and 10-year Treasuries.  Or are they in the same habitat.  And, in particular, does the fact that a corporation can operate in its own debt make it different from Treasuries.  And would that short-circuit the effect you want to have on the shape of the yield curve in the Treasury market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 153.
 MR. SACK.  I would argue that what we have seen from the experiences with the Federal Reserve policies is that there clearly is preferred habitat across the Treasury curve, across maturities.  I would imagine that, to a large degree, you would see some of that preferred habitat pass through on the corporate side as well.  I wouldn’t view corporates as a single asset class where duration doesn’t matter.  Are you asking if the degree of market segmentation is greater in Treasuries than in corporates across maturities.  That is a bit harder.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting their argument and asking for clarification on a specific question.


Passage number 154.
 MR. LACKER.  The intuition in habitat theory is the costliness or riskiness of arbitrage.  A corporation can scoop up its own debt pretty easily.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply explains the intuition behind habitat theory and how a corporation can easily repurchase its own debt.


Passage number 155.
 MR. SACK.  Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 156.
  Maybe I’m missing the connection there, but— MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Another way of saying it is in the Treasury market we expected there to be a twisting of the yield curve; we weren’t particularly surprised that the two-year yields went up a little bit and then the longer-term yields came down.  Ceteris paribus, we would have expected to see a similar effect in the corporate bond market for the same reasons.  I don’t know if they did, but if two-year corporates did go up, that wouldn’t be at odds with what we expected.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their expectation and uncertainty about the behavior of two-year corporates in the bond market.


Passage number 157.
  Whereas, we would have expected 10-year corporates that have— MR. SACK.  I’m not sure what the corporate arbitrage is here.  I don’t think there is an incentive for them to equalize their corporate yields across the yield curve or something, if that’s what you mean.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I wonder if there is a constituency for taking a vote on domestic open market operations.  [Laughter]  Without objection.  It is 3:15.  Let’s take 20 minutes for coffee.  Thank you.   [Coffee break] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Why don’t we recommence.  The next item on the agenda is the economic situation, and I will call on David Wilcox.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It is a discussion about corporate yields, voting on domestic open market operations, and taking a coffee break during a meeting. There is no indication of disagreement or conflict.


Passage number 158.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have a brief question related to our discussion of nominal income targeting.  Looking not just at the change in real GDP in the year of liftoff—it might be interesting to look at the cumulative output gap of real GDP or nominal GDP at the time of liftoff.  So maybe we’re at minus 7 percent now—just thinking about putting in the Tealbook estimates of potential GDP and then thinking about how the forecasts of real GDP have evolved relative to that.  I don’t know if I’m making sense. MS. MESTER.  Yes, you are.  One thing is in the handout that we distributed on Monday—we did deviations from the long run—an individual’s forecast of long run.  You can at least see how far away they are from where they think the long-run gap is.  But I would direct you to look at those, and maybe that’ll give you some insight. The other thing we thought about doing is amending the one chart that is basically “Year of Liftoff” in levels.  You could imagine doing changes and then doing a central tendency and the range of that.  But derivatives of derivatives of derivatives get to me, although I read your memo, and you have a third derivative in your loss function.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speakers appear to be engaging in a conversation and understanding each other's points.


Passage number 159.
  [Laughter] MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  A lot of functions have a third derivative.  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The laughter indicates that the statement made by Mr. Kocherlakota is meant to be humorous, rather than causing any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 160.
 MR. FISHER.  Just a point for David and the international side—to tie them together.  In talking to the oil companies—which include Exxon; it has pretty good information—what they note is that gasoline–diesel demand is off 2 percent year to date.  But what has occurred is that with the slowdown in European growth, there is less refinery output, meaning less exports to the East Coast of the United States.  As a result, they haven’t seen the decrease in motor gas prices that they had expected.  So there is this odd phenomenon.  It is an international market.  It’s marked off of Brent, by the way, not off of WTI.  But it’s a refinery concept.  The slowdown in Europe is actually affecting supply in the United States, even though demand has come up somewhat.  The same is true for av gas—that, in the parlance of business, the crack spread has just not narrowed.  The question is, when will it happen.  But the pressures are moving in that direction from a demand standpoint.  I wanted to make that point. On food prices, the entire structure seems to be supported by Chinese demand.  Soybean oil, for example, which is the most important—10 years ago, they imported 5 million tons; this year, they’ll import 60 million tons.  I mention that because, if you look at the headline PCE number, Mr. Chairman, of that 2 percent, 1.7 percent was either gasoline or food—1.4 was gas and 0.3 was food—and the rest, the core, of course, was flat, in keeping with what the trimmed mean was forecasting, as I’ve said, at a six-month run rate. For what it’s worth, I think you need to take note of that phenomenon.  The international side is definitely impacting, in both gas and food, what is happening here in the United States.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It provides information and observations about the impact of international factors on gasoline and food prices in the United States.


Passage number 161.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I have a question for Steve.  I want to clarify something you said.  When you were talking about the bank capital issue in Europe, you said “asked to raise.”  I’m not sure I would characterize it quite that way—in the sense that it’s a shortfall based on a 9 percent capital ratio, but they’re not really forced to raise it; they’re just supposed to get to a 9 percent capital ratio.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply seeking clarification and expressing their own understanding of the situation being discussed.


Passage number 162.
 MR. KAMIN.  Oh, right.  What I thought I said—but I might have erred in my reading—was that they are required to raise it one way or another.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing uncertainty about what they said, but there is no opposing viewpoint or conflicting argument presented.


Passage number 163.
  VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no specific information or context provided in the passage to suggest any sort of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 164.
 MR. KAMIN.  Their first option will be to go to the private markets.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 165.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  They’re not really raising.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 166.
 MR. TARULLO.They can cut assets, too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention any disagreement or contention. It is a statement made by Mr. Tarullo about the possibility of cutting assets.


Passage number 167.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  All they have to do is get to the right ratio at the end of the day.  They could shrink to get to that ratio; they can change the risk-weighted assets.  I just wanted to clarify that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply providing information and clarifying a concept.


Passage number 168.
 MR. KAMIN.  Thank you—that’s correct.  In their statements and in their discussion, they are very eager that that target not be achieved through deleveraging.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the individuals mentioned are eager for a target to not be achieved through deleveraging.


Passage number 169.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  But that’s a loose EBA instruction.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This phrase simply states a general instruction without any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 170.
 MR. KAMIN.  Exactly.  That is, indeed, a loose instruction.  And so they’re trying not to have that be the case.  They have talked about restricting dividends and things like that in order to achieve that, but thank you for that clarification. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Kamin is simply expressing agreement with President Rosengren's statement and thanking him for the clarification.


Passage number 171.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  My question is for Steve, but it’s a financial stability question, which is: You highlighted the 50 percent voluntary write-down, and the CDSs presumably are not going to be triggered; I wonder if you have any views on what that means for the CDS market going forward.  If you thought you were being hedged against sovereign debt default, then not only for Greece but also for all your sovereign debt, all of a sudden it looks as though that hedge isn’t a very good hedge.  And if you think that sovereigns could play that game not only for sovereigns but also possibly for bank debt if the bank was large relative to the size of the country, you start wondering whether that contract any longer has viability.  But all of a sudden then, do you want to hold sovereign debt if you can’t hedge it.  So it starts having implications for the yields going forward.  So I was wondering if you have views on that.  Then I think this is really a question for another time, maybe, that the financial stability people could pick up on.  But given how often the CDSs are cited, I wonder if you have any views on that—or Nellie or anybody else.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a question being asked by Mr. Rosengren about the implications of a certain situation on the CDS market.


Passage number 172.
 MR. KAMIN.  I’ll just start by saying that’s an excellent point, and it’s something that people have raised as an issue.  It is interesting that those same concerns came up after the July agreement by Europeans to impose a haircut of only 20 percent on private creditors.  And in the event, that concern seems to have been shrugged off, but it’s come up again with this much larger haircut.  One could imagine a situation after this, especially if it goes through, where indeed the role of CDSs could diminish.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 173.
 MR. SACK.  My sense is that it’s not being shrugged off as easily this time.  There is a lot of discussion about this, and it’s a serious potential problem.  You see it in the prices.  The CDS spreads have come in much more or have come in even in cases where the cash spreads have not, so I think you’re already starting to see some slippage in the prices.  And if they are no longer effective as a hedging instrument, it would have the implications that you raised. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Are there any other staff who want to comment. MS. LIANG.  I don’t think I’m going to add too much to that.  That is an issue that was raised very quickly, and so that is something we’re reviewing to see if there’s any measurable effect on the cash spreads and the CDS.  But as Steve pointed out, in July and last year, when they talked about extending maturities, it appeared to get shrugged off, though the effects on CDS values were a big concern at the time.  This time we’re starting to see a little bit of an effect, but it’s a hard question to answer.  We’ll try to come back with something. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. While there is some discussion about the effects of cash spreads and CDS spreads, there is no direct contention or disagreement between the speakers.


Passage number 174.
 MR. PLOSSER.  I want to turn to the trial run.  I want to make a comment and maybe even ask a question here.  One of the things I find interesting about this is the difference in part between exhibit 1 and exhibit 2.  As Loretta pointed out, if you look at exhibit 1, it looks as though there are huge spreads about what people expect. I think it’s important we remember two things about that.  One is that this is appropriate policy and not a forecast.  I think that’s important to understand what we’re doing.  But also, as she pointed out in exhibit 2, the modal forecasts here reveal a somewhat different story than you’d get by just looking at the first chart.  And the modal forecasts are much closer to what the Committee has been signaling through its forms of forward guidance. I think the other thing that’s important to remember about this is that the value of this, as I see it, is not just as a snapshot in time, but it’s also to watch how this exercise would evolve every quarter as the economy evolved, and therefore how this shape would evolve.  And that’s part of the information, rather than a point in time.  It’s the evolution of that that would be very revealing, I think, over time.  So from my perspective, this could be a very valuable exercise for the Committee to undertake. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  First time anybody ever estimated a Taylor rule on panel data.  [Laughter]  Any other questions.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Plosser is simply expressing his thoughts and opinions about the exhibit and the value of the exercise, without any opposing views.


Passage number 175.
 MR. TARULLO.  I think I drew a somewhat different inference than Charlie did, because I found myself focused on panel B in exhibit 4, which had quite a bit of variance.  If at some level the most relevant piece of information for markets is when the Fed will begin to exit—if I looked at that, I’m not sure I would be too confident in drawing any conclusions.  Go ahead.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. Mr. Tarullo is providing his own perspective and interpretation of the information, but there is no direct disagreement with Charlie or anyone else mentioned in the passage.


Passage number 176.
 MR. PLOSSER.  I think the question might then be to look at that in the same sort of bar chart—in other words, looking at the modal numbers on that chart rather than just the spread and central tendency.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not display contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by MR. PLOSSER proposing a different approach to analyzing a bar chart.


Passage number 177.
 MR. LACKER.  Which chart are you talking about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 178.
 MR. TARULLO.  I’m talking about the lower right-hand column of panel B.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a statement made by Mr. Tarullo regarding a specific section of panel B.


Passage number 179.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Oh, I’m sorry.  I misunderstood.  I thought you were looking at panel A. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Exhibit 4.B—PCE inflation versus unemployment rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It only shows a misunderstanding and clarification of which panel is being referred to.


Passage number 180.
 MR. TARULLO.  Very last page, very last panel, very last graph.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 181.
 MR. LACKER.  It would be hard to pick a consensus trigger out of that or a threshold.  Is that what you take from this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement or contention in this passage. Mr. Lacker is saying that it is difficult to determine a consensus trigger or threshold from the information given, implying a disagreement with the previous statements or suggestions.


Passage number 182.
 MR. TARULLO.  Yes.  That returns me to the question I had earlier, which was whether, if there were three kinds of scenarios, there would be more convergence.  And this graph at least suggests that there might not be a whole lot more convergence.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply stating that a graph suggests that there might not be a significant amount of convergence in three different scenarios.


Passage number 183.
 MR. LACKER.  You can make them into three clumps.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement presented in the passage. The statement by Mr. Lacker simply suggests a way to categorize or group items.


Passage number 184.
 MR. TARULLO.  Maybe that’s right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing uncertainty or agreement with the previous statement.


Passage number 185.
 MR. LACKER.  Maybe not.  I don’t know. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement expressed in this passage. It is a response indicating uncertainty or lack of knowledge.


Passage number 186.
   MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Yes, I wanted to build on something I had said earlier after Governor Tarullo’s earlier remarks.  Frankly, when I speak about the economy, I’m not sure people are all that interested in what I would do with the fed funds rate if I were in charge—they want to know what I expect this Committee to do.  And when we use the SEP, I’m not sure we want to be thinking about it as conveying the full richness of all of our views about the economy, as opposed to trying to use it to convey what we think is going to be happening to policy tools. I think it’s right to condition our long-run forecasts on optimal monetary policy.  That gives the people the right idea of what the long-run target is.  Conditioning our forecast for the fed funds rate and for inflation and unemployment on that—I don’t think that’s going to convey the right kind of information to markets.  Markets want to know where we think those variables are going to go and how we think policy is going to respond to that and what we think policy will be, as opposed to under what we think optimal policy should be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion on the use of the SEP (Summary of Economic Projections) as a tool for conveying information about the economy and monetary policy. They suggest that the SEP should focus on conveying forecasts for variables such as the fed funds rate, inflation, and unemployment, rather than providing a comprehensive view of all Committee members' views on the economy. This is a personal opinion and viewpoint, rather than a disagreement with others in the passage.


Passage number 187.
 MR. TARULLO.  Narayana, there’s insight in that observation.  How, in practical terms, then, do you think one gets from the manifestation of everybody’s individual inclinations, which this graph shows, on the one hand, to something resembling more of a consensus, which, I read into your remarks, you would expect to actually be way less divergent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Tarullo, is acknowledging the insight in Narayana's observation and seeking practical approaches to move towards more consensus.


Passage number 188.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I would be interested to see a different trial run where we make a forecast predicated on what we think the Committee will do, what the evolution of inflation, unemployment, and real GDP will be, on the one hand, and what the evolution of the fed funds rate will be, on the other hand.  And we’ll see—maybe I’m wrong.  Maybe there won’t be more convergence on that, but my suspicion is that there would be a lot more convergence. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  This is important information, though—what people’s preferences are.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing interest in a different approach and acknowledging that they could be wrong.


Passage number 189.
 MR. TARULLO.  Yes, I was going to ask you about that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Tarullo simply states that he was going to ask about something without expressing any disagreement or contention.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 190.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  It’s very reasonable for us internally to have that information.  I will say for myself, I don’t think it’s as important for the public.  I’m all in favor of transparency, but I have many vehicles to inform the public of my personal preferences over these variables.  I’m not sure that seeing them in this bar chart form is all that valuable.  It’s valuable for us to know—panel 4.B is really useful for us to know in our own internal dialogue.  But it doesn’t necessarily mean that’s going to be what we should share with the public. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Pages 3 and 4 were intended for internal use.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage contains disagreement or contention. The speaker, Mr. Kocherlakota, argues that while it is valuable for the Federal Reserve to have access to certain information internally, he does not think it is important or valuable to share that information with the public. He believes that his personal preferences over these variables can be communicated to the public through other means. This disagreement centers around the level of transparency and what information is deemed valuable for public consumption.


Passage number 191.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  And that’s very valuable, but when we go out and talk about what we want to share with the public, what’s going to be useful in terms of shaping policy, I think it’s more about trying to tell the people what we think the Committee is going to be doing, as opposed to what we would do if we were in charge of the Committee.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I’m not sure I agree with that.  President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 192.
 MR. WILLIAMS.  No, I’ll pass. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Both Mr. Williams and President Bullard seem to be in agreement as Mr. Williams states he will pass on something.


Passage number 193.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I just wanted to follow up on that.  There is literature that looks at the forecasts by the group here.  They treat them as unconditional forecasts, and they look at whether it’s accurate or not.  They forget all about the “appropriate policy” assumption, and so I think there are a lot of subtle issues here.  If you think the Committee is off on the wrong path, you might forecast that inflation is going to go way down or way up—way far away from target, for instance.  And do you want that.   Other central banks have wrestled with this.  They’ve done the projection based on the market expectation, which is a reasonable compromise.  Or they’ve allowed the staff forecast to go out and have let the principals just comment on the staff forecast.  So I’m not sure—this is a difficult issue, I think. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Anyone else.  [No response]  Okay.  We’re ready for our go-round, and let’s start with President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply presenting different ideas and perspectives on how forecasts should be approached and evaluated.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 194.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll do my best to ensure that we complete this meeting by nine o’clock tonight.  [Laughter] In our recent round of board meetings and contacts, the majority of directors and business contacts in the Sixth District described activity as expanding at a slow pace.  While most reports were a bit more upbeat than before the last FOMC, a plurality of directors and their contacts stated that they had revised down expectations for their firms’ performance.  Two directors representing the country’s second-largest retailer and largest airline expressed pessimism about the business outlook, citing continuing uncertainty and weak confidence emanating particularly from the political process.  Overall, I would characterize what we heard over the past two weeks as falling in a range from “still somewhat pessimistic” to “very cautiously optimistic.”  In our questioning of directors and other contacts, we asked about intentions to hire or reduce staffing in the coming months.  Although we heard some rumblings about reducing employment, the modal response was no near-term intention either to hire beyond replacement requirements or seasonal needs or to downsize staffing.  Most firms seem to be holding steady as regards staffing. In our formal survey of business inflation sentiment—this time, it involved 164 respondents—we detected less pressure on input costs than earlier in the year.  Also, no significant wage pressures were noted.  However, the vast majority of respondents noted that they intended to pass on at least some of any cost increase to their customers.  Businesses in the transportation sector noted that they have faced little resistance to surcharges to cover fuel cost increases. Turning to my sense of the outlook, Atlanta’s forecast is very similar to the Tealbook’s through 2013.  In the last year of the forecast horizon—2014—we depart from the Tealbook’s trajectory and project flatter growth, reflecting the weight of fiscal drag, continued deleveraging, and restrained consumer confidence.  Our forecast has unemployment above the Tealbook’s 2014 projection and above the 6½ to 7 percent projections suggested in version A1 of the Tealbook draft statements.  At the same time, our inflation forecast stays in the neighborhood of 2 percent over the forecast horizon, while the Tealbook numbers stay south of 2 percent.  Therefore, we have assumed less slack in the economy than the Board staff. To be more specific, I have a strong sense that the labor market involves much more in the way of inchoate rigidities, inefficiencies, and behavioral impediments than fully appreciated.  Now, admittedly, I am basing this sense on a lot of anecdotal input, but here is some of what we’re picking up.  With respect to the relatively slow pace at which reported job openings are being filled, we are in fact told that some vacancies are so-called purple squirrel openings:  If a purple squirrel shows up, the company will hire; otherwise, the company waits.  [Laughter]  My sense is that this employer attitude will change if confidence increases and demand picks up.  But we are also consistently told of many skills mismatches.  These mismatches are related to hard skills in specific industries and job types, but we hear much more broadly of issues related to soft skills, such as basic work habits, attitudes, and expectations.  I frequently hear of jobs going unfilled because a large number of applicants have difficulty passing basic requirements like drug tests or simply demonstrating the requisite work ethic.  As an example, one contact in the staffing industry told us that during their pretesting process, a majority—actually, 60 percent of applicants—failed to answer “0” to the question of how many days a week it’s acceptable to miss work.  [Laughter]  Now, I am not suggesting that these are necessarily new phenomena.  But for a variety of reasons, employers seem to be paying much more attention to the quality of prospective hires than pre-recession.  We also hear that job requirements have been updated to combine a wider spectrum of performance competencies, such as those that are required for receipt of the ACT’s National Career Readiness Certificate. There is anecdotal evidence of structural shifts.  Companies of various sizes in various industries report moving to increase their permanent part-time workforce, typically as a way to manage uncertainties about health-care expenses and requirements.  Now, I stress that these are anecdotal accounts, and the effects are difficult to quantify.  But combining these and other inputs with the somewhat confusing participation data suggests to me that a great deal is going on in labor markets that we don’t fully grasp.  And I am not quite ready to argue that all this means the structural rate of unemployment is permanently higher, but I am inclined to think that clear progress in the labor market will lag economic growth more than usual.  Further, I am somewhat skeptical of the capacity of monetary policy measures to speed up the process. Let me conclude with comments on the balance of risks.  I see risks to growth to the downside.  Financial market volatility, slow jobs growth, and weak confidence make the economy vulnerable to any number of adverse shocks.  Regarding inflation, I judge the risks to be broadly balanced, reflecting some ambivalence on the question of the amount of slack in the economy.  It is possible that the high unemployment rate reflects more slack than I have assumed in my inflation outlook.  But as my earlier recitation of anecdotal input suggests, the labor market could be struggling under the weight of forces that have raised the natural rate of unemployment for at least some time.  I also think there is a chance that the influence of commodity prices and other pressures on core inflation numbers could play out over a longer period than I have assumed, and inflationary sentiment could be adversely affected as a result.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement or contention in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Lockhart, expresses disagreement with the Board staff's forecast and assumptions about the labor market. He believes there are more inefficiencies and impediments in the labor market than are being recognized, and he is skeptical of the effectiveness of monetary policy measures. He also sees risks to growth to the downside, while the Board staff sees risks as broadly balanced.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 195.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The markets seem to have initially taken some solace in the Europeans having an outline of actions with no details and in U.S. economic data consistent with growth that does not improve the employment situation.  That such diminished expectations can generate a market rally is hardly encouraging.  As Brian highlighted, it is even less encouraging that a referendum in a small country can offset much of those gains.  This highlights the fragile financial condition as we try to make our own forecast. My forecast, like that in the Tealbook, provides little to celebrate—positive but weak growth given the sizable output gap, positive but weak employment growth that leaves us far from full employment, and inflation that remains below 2 percent.  By mid-2013, I expect we will still have an unemployment rate above 8 percent and an inflation rate well below 2 percent.  The Tealbook has a similar forecast.  If these forecasts are right, we will be missing on both elements of the mandate two years from now. Financial market participants remain concerned.  Liquidity in many markets is sporadic at best.  Financial institutions, worried about their own liquidity risk, are not supporting markets to the same degree, making financial market participants less willing to take positions that may be difficult to exit.  My own interpretation is that in many markets, European and American institutions that have been dependent on wholesale financing are pulling back from activities, resulting in marketmakers less willing to make markets.  While there has been some increased refinancing activity, and the newly announced HARP changes are positive, both the movement in mortgage rates and the fiscal willingness to encourage refinancing remain too timid to have much macroeconomic effect.  Our econometric equations imply that we are well below the level of construction implied by fundamentals at this time.  And buyer concern about future prices and the tightness of credit conditions make a very gradual return to normal in housing the most likely outcome. My business contacts indicate widespread caution.  Given the possibility that deficit discussions remain dysfunctional and European brinkmanship remains the negotiating tool of choice, businesses would prefer to defer hiring and investment decisions until there is more clarity in the outlook. Given the weak performance we have experienced and the weakness in our forecast, our incremental policy is not the best approach.  Critics of Japanese policymakers focus on a slow, deliberate approach that led to very suboptimal outcomes, with 20 years of slow growth and inflation below targets.  If we do not start seeing more-robust improvement, then the likely fiscal austerity and continued downside risk from Europe put such improvement at significant risk.  We will need to decide whether incremental policies are likely to return us to either element of our mandate in the medium term.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in this passage. The author expresses concern and dissatisfaction with the current state of the markets and the economy. They believe that the actions taken by European policymakers and the weak economic data are not encouraging, and that the forecast for the future is also weak. They also highlight concerns about liquidity in financial markets and the reluctance of institutions to support markets. Additionally, the author expresses doubts about the effectiveness of incremental policies and suggests that a more robust approach may be necessary.


Passage number 196.
 MR. WILLIAMS.  This was a comparison—I should have spelled this out a little more carefully—of what our forecast or view of potential output was in 2007, before the recession.  Basically, it was that trend line and seeing how much the decline in the level of potential output in the end of 2004 is relative to that in 2007.  It’s not just in the past six weeks. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So what is your potential output relative to the Tealbook.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any indication of contention or disagreement. It simply explains a comparison of potential output before the recession.


Passage number 197.
 MR. WILLIAMS.  It’s 1 percent because our output gap is 5 percent.  The Tealbook, I think, is 6 percent in Q3.  So it’s just a 1 percentage point difference. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.  The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement of numbers and a thank you.


Passage number 198.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Eighth District economy continues to expand at a modest pace.  The Eighth District unemployment rate based on 16 metropolitan statistical areas is somewhat lower than the national rate, at 8.7 percent.  Payroll employment in the District was approximately flat during the most recent reporting period. Large firms in the District remain optimistic and plan to expand in some cases.  Profitability remains strong.  Cash holdings are high.  Many large firms have a strong presence in Asia, and in almost every case, the growth strategy is based on Asian demand.  In this sense, the European sovereign debt crisis is not upsetting business planning or entering corporate thinking as anything more than a general risk factor, and Asian growth is still considered mostly unassailable at this juncture. District agriculture continues to do well.  Relatively high prices, even with higher input prices, mean farm income will likely remain strong this year.  As an indicator, some farm equipment dealers are reportedly sold out through the spring of 2012. Commercial real estate conditions are variable across the District.  Residential real estate continues to be lackluster in many areas.  Banks continue to report very weak loan demand. The national economy now appears to have avoided the recession scare that gripped financial markets during the August time frame, even though the level of global financial stress remains high.  If a recession was developing during the September–October time frame, the hard data would have been considerably worse than they were.  My sense is that market expectations outran actual economic developments.  As it stands, I expect moderate growth during the remainder of 2011, with reasonably good prospects for improved growth during 2012, provided that significant financial stress can be mitigated. The types of risk events that occurred during the past several months have apparently not been of a variety that might cause households and businesses to pull back spending sharply and set off a recessionary event.  For households, the European sovereign debt crisis is worrying but too distant to cause immediate changes in spending patterns.  For large businesses, the EU crisis is, again, very worrying, but much of their growth strategy is in Asia so that both growth and profitability remain on track for them.  For both businesses and households, the debt ceiling debate only confirmed the political realities in the U.S. concerning the difficulty of dealing with medium- and longer-term fiscal issues.  Despite the contentiousness of the debate, there was no real news about the U.S. fiscal situation. The July 29 revisions to GDP, as we have noted here on several occasions, were indeed significant and did lead to legitimate worry of a further slowdown or outright recession.  But the Q3 hard data did not confirm this view, so now I think we’re in a position to expect reasonable but not stellar growth going forward. In the meantime, headline and core inflation have not subsided to the extent that one might have predicted based on the estimated size of the output gap.  One reasonable interpretation is that the output gap is not nearly as large as suggested by conventional analysis.  Reverse engineering the output gap using the method of Laubach and Williams—our colleague just to my left here—for instance, suggests that movements in core inflation are indicating a gap of about 2 to 3 percent, much smaller than suggested by other metrics.  This makes a lot of sense if one is willing to attribute some of the growth in the past decade not to fundamental factors but to an unsustainable bubble in housing and real estate more generally.  Indeed, this fits with our rhetoric about the past decade very well.  I think this hypothesis bears careful watching during the coming quarters and years.  Thank you.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lacker.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 201.
  VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you.  The way I would characterize the outlook is, we got a little bounce that we were hoping for.  The positive of that is that the sharp drop we saw in household and business confidence does not seem to have led to a pullback in hiring or spending, but I think we shouldn’t get overimpressed by 2½ percent growth in the third quarter.  Some of the bounce was due to temporary factors such as autos, and the increase in consumption was accompanied by a pretty big drop in the household saving rate, which may indicate that there is actually some stress on household balance sheets.  And finally, some significant obstacles to growth remain.   In my mind, there are three key determinants of the outlook over the next few quarters.  The first one is Europe, and we saw earlier how powerful the contagion was back to the U.S., especially in terms of those financial intermediaries, like Morgan Stanley, that have very limited access to the Fed’s lender-of-last resort function.  If Europe goes badly, then there is a real risk to the U.S. financial system; and then, by extension, to financial conditions; and then to the real economy.  So although the bilateral exposures don’t look so great, the actual consequence would be quite severe.  On Europe, I agree with Steve’s characterization that there is lots of assembly required, probably a few missing parts, and no real assurance that it’s going to work in practice. A couple of things I would note.  The first thing about the Greek restructuring that’s really quite interesting is that even with a 50 percent haircut, full participation of all of the private-sector participants, optimistic assumptions on growth, and the fiscal austerity package being implemented, they still end up with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 120 percent in 2020.  Now, the reason why this is happening is that as more and more Greek debt gets socialized into official hands like the ECB and the IMF, the haircuts to the private sector have very diminished consequences to the total Greek debt burden.  So I think that really raises a question:  Is 50 percent restructuring enough, or is this the first in a series of Greek restructurings.  Or is Greece ultimately going to default. The second issue associated with the Greek restructuring that’s noteworthy is, it’s not clear that this is being done in a way that actually makes other sovereign debt look more attractive.  You could argue that it makes it look less attractive because, one, you now have the precedent of restructuring in place, and, two, as we discussed earlier, if the CDS are not triggered, then you no longer have a way of hedging your sovereign debt.  So I think in some ways, this actually makes the rest of the European debt look a little bit less attractive.  If you can subordinate the Greek debt holders, the more that the ECB buys of Irish, Portuguese, Spanish, and Italian debt, you’re essentially de facto subordinating those holders as well.  And I think at some point, they’re going to catch on to that. The second thing I would say about Greece—we talked about this before:  the bank recapitalization.  They have a €106 billion shortfall.  But press reports indicate that very little of this is expected to be met by new investor equity.  In fact, most of it’s going to be done by retained earnings, changing business model, and deleveraging.  I think one of the real key questions is, how does that deleveraging hurt economic growth—and then does that feedback make it more difficult to make progress in terms of fiscal consolidation. Lastly, there are two more issues with Europe—the next one is, does the EFSF actually have enough capacity to do all the things that they need to do.  The reason we have this 20 percent first-loss piece is that the EFSF has only €440 billion of capacity, and a lot of that capacity is already spoken for in terms of Greece, Ireland, and Portugal.  So you have a pretty Rube Goldberg type of machine, and nobody really knows if investors are actually going to have much appetite for this debt that has a 20 percent first-loss piece.  And then the final thing, the thing I think was probably the most disappointing regarding the European announcement—there’s really no vision yet at all about where Europe is headed over the medium to longer run.  What’s the exit strategy of all of these programs.  How are they going to enforce conditionality in terms of fiscal consolidation on an ongoing basis.  How do these countries reenter the market and actually issue debt to private investors two, three, four years down the road.  I’m pretty pessimistic about what’s actually going to transpire in Europe.  So that’s issue number one. Issue number two is housing, and I think there are a lot of problems there.  Obviously, the first problem is the high loan to value.  Mortgage holders are locked into high-coupon mortgages, and that’s basically impeding the power of monetary policy to actually support the housing sector and household consumer spending.  The second problem is the slow pace of foreclosures that you highlighted, which is bad in itself, but it also creates a greater incentive to default because if you already know it’s—what was it, 397 days until the foreclosure actually is ended.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses pessimism about the outlook for Europe and raises questions about the effectiveness of the Greek restructuring. They also express concern about the capacity of EFSF and the lack of a clear vision for the future of Europe. This contrasts with a more optimistic view of the bounce in the economy and the lack of a pullback in hiring or spending.


Passage number 202.
  MR. PLOSSER.  In New Jersey, it was 900 days.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It simply states a number of days.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 203.
 MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, can I ask Brian a question.  Yesterday in his presentation, he said that it was our description of the economy that you felt was a little harsher than markets expected.  I’m interpolating your words.  The operative word here is “significant.”  Is that what you were referring to in terms of statement B as it’s drafted.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker is questioning Brian's statement and asking for clarification on what exactly he meant by "significant" in relation to statement B. This indicates a disagreement or contention in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 204.
 MR. SACK.  I think that’s what received a lot of attention in markets.  Just to be clear, I had thought the first two paragraphs of that statement were essentially marking to market in a way that was pretty obvious.  But market participants actually took a more negative signal from it than I had anticipated.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Sack, expresses surprise or disagreement with market participants who interpreted the statement in a more negative way than he had anticipated.


Passage number 205.
 MR. FISHER.  Well, have they digested that word “significant” by now in your opinion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a simple question asking for the opinion of the person being addressed.


Passage number 206.
 MR. SACK.  Yes, I would imagine their expectation is that that clause would be repeated.  We didn’t ask that explicitly, but certainly given the volatility in markets and the uncertainties that they see, I think they wouldn’t be surprised to have that sentence repeated with the word “significant.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their imagination and thoughts about the expectations of a particular clause being repeated.


Passage number 207.
” MR. FISHER.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Any other questions for Bill.  [No response]  All right.  Let’s begin our go-round with President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses gratitude and there is no response from the audience, indicating agreement or lack of disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 208.
 MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  I also favor maintaining the “at least through mid-2013” forward guidance and including the word “significant” in describing the downside risks.  I think that’s accurate.  In my view, appropriate policy entails liftoff of the funds rate from its current level around mid-2014.  This is similar to the median of market participants’ expectations, so I don’t see a compelling need at this time to try to move market expectations by changing our policy guidance. In thinking about the appropriate stance of monetary policy, I find it useful to consider a variety of simple estimated and calibrated monetary policy rules.  I’m less swayed by the optimal control simulations, which are highly sensitive to the model and underlying forecasts, and I don’t think they’re as reliable a guide for policy.  But currently, with considerable slack, slow growth, and fairly low inflation, the central tendency of these policy rules is completely consistent with the current very accommodative stance of monetary policy.  Furthermore, the central tendency of these policy rules doesn’t predict lifting off from the zero lower bound until around mid-2014. Of course, simple rules are only partial guides to our policy decisions, and there are three key reasons why we may want to adjust the prescriptions from these rules.  First, because of the zero lower bound, we haven’t been able to follow the prescriptions of the policy rules into negative territory.  So there’s no reason to think that we should follow them regarding the policy liftoff.  Indeed, much research, including work I’ve done with Dave Reifschneider, suggests that policy should stay at zero longer than standard policy rules would suggest following an episode at the zero bound.  A policy rule based on our analysis suggests liftoff in early 2015.  Furthermore, the normal channels of monetary transmission remain unusually clogged.  Many businesses and households are unable to take on new debt or want to shed existing debt, muting the effects of monetary policy stimulus.  If this reduced effectiveness persists, additional policy accommodation is needed, and liftoff should be delayed relative to the simple rules’ prescription.  However, working in the opposite direction, the simple rules ignore the sizable additional accommodation from our unconventional monetary policies.  The additional stimulus from lower term premiums and longer-term yields suggests that our short-term policy could lift off somewhat earlier than the simple rules suggest. I view these and other arguments that deviate from the policy rules as roughly canceling out.  So I remain fairly comfortable with the rules-based prescription of a mid-2014 liftoff as a modal forecast.  Importantly, I foresee a relatively modest pace of increases after liftoff, with the funds rate ending 2014 at only 75 basis points. Finally, there are significant downside risks to the outlook for the economy, as we discussed yesterday, and I therefore recognize that the date of liftoff could be significantly later than mid-2014.  And obviously, depending on the actual evolution of the forecast for economic activity and inflation, we may need to change our policy guidance and use further large-scale asset purchases or lower the reserve rates as needed, but right now I see alternative B as appropriate. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in this passage. Mr. Williams supports maintaining the "at least through mid-2013" forward guidance and a mid-2014 liftoff of the funds rate, while also acknowledging the possibility of delaying liftoff depending on the actual evolution of the economic forecast. However, he also mentions arguments that deviate from the policy rules, such as the reduced effectiveness of monetary policy and the additional stimulus from unconventional monetary policies, which could suggest an earlier liftoff. Overall, Mr. Williams remains fairly comfortable with the rules-based prescription, but the mention of these differing arguments shows some contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 209.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Yesterday I discussed the Boston forecast and talked about inflation being at 1½ percent, roughly where the Tealbook was, by mid-2013.  Both the Boston forecast and the Board forecast come from a particular econometric tradition, so I thought it was noteworthy to at least look at the memos on DSGE models.  And interestingly, from all four of those banks, they came up with roughly the same estimate that both the Tealbook and the Boston Fed forecast, which was roughly 1½ percent.  In fact, I think 1½ is a high rather than a low for both those four banks and those coming from a different econometric tradition. What that would seem to say is that there is some flexibility, if we are going to have an inflation rate below 2 percent two to three years out, to do more accommodation in order to get a better result on the unemployment rate.  The reason you wouldn’t do that is, one, you might think that we couldn’t affect the interest rate, or, two, if we did affect interest rates, it would have no impact.  Brian yesterday showed the percent of Treasuries that we’re buying, and showed that in a number of issues, we’re buying a very significant amount.  I have no doubt that if we’re willing to buy a very significant amount, we have the ability to move down both Treasury rates and mortgage-backed securities rates.  It’s a question of will, not whether we can do it or not.  It isn’t a question of whether we can move those interest rates. So then the question is, if we can move those interest rates, what is the likelihood it would have any impact.  Some analysts have argued that pushing long rates down through quantitative easing would have no effect.  No effect is a very restrictive assumption, but it has been cited by a wide number of analysts.  That assumption means that housing is unresponsive to lower rates; that consumption, including autos and durables, is unresponsive to interest rates; that exchange rates in the foreign sector are unresponsive despite the complaints by many of our foreign trading partners about the quantitative easing; and that investment is unresponsive to lower rates. I asked the people who do our model to test the assumption of whether the interest responsiveness of each of these components is really zero.  Not surprisingly, my prior was that they wouldn’t find that zero was the right answer.  And when they did that, they did find that in housing, the coefficient was much lower, but they didn’t find that the coefficient was 0—which is, housing is responsive; it’s not as responsive as it would be without all of the various headwinds.  But in those other sectors, they couldn’t reject the assumption that in the past several years, interest rates have affected those sectors in the same way that they did prior to the past several years.  So it is interesting that it does seem, from at least the econometric analysis done at the Boston Fed, that in using the model that we use for the forecast, we actually do find that if we chose to push interest rates lower, it would have an impact on the economy, contrary to what at least some analysts have argued. When I look at alternative B, which maintains the exceptionally low rates “at least through mid-2013,” our forecast implies that the language in alternative A would actually be more appropriate.  Should we leave policy unchanged when both elements of the mandate are missed in the medium term.  We’re not at full employment, and we’re lower than 2 percent for the inflation rate.  My preference would be to use this meeting to clearly communicate that rates will remain exceptionally low until unemployment is 7 percent or the inflation rate exceeds 2½ percent in the medium term.  At our next meeting, if the outlook once again envisions unacceptable progress toward our primary goals, we need to consider taking more forceful action. Were we to have a shock from a large bank failure here or abroad, a European crisis, or the inability to reach agreement on our debt problems, aggressive monetary actions, perhaps coupled with a move to nominal GDP targeting to signal a regime change, would clearly be appropriate.  But even our baseline forecast implies a lost decade for many people in the workforce.  We should consider soon whether more vigorous policies are necessary.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is presenting different viewpoints on the effectiveness of pushing interest rates lower through quantitative easing. Some analysts argue that it would have no effect, while the speaker believes that there is evidence from econometric analysis that it would have an impact on the economy.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 210.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Today I support further actions by the Committee to provide additional significant monetary accommodation.  I am not arguing that economic conditions have deteriorated further and thus require this additional action.  I am arguing that the progression of adding stimulus needs to continue.  In my assessment, there are significant benefits to credibly solidifying expectations that policy will continue to be extraordinarily accommodative as long as conditions warrant.  I spoke about the risk-management benefits at length yesterday, and I hope that the record properly reflects those comments here as well in the interest of time. As I’ve stated here and in public, I interpret our dual-mandate responsibilities to be closely associated with minimizing a quadratic policy loss function, which puts equal weights on price stability and maximum employment as captured by unemployment deviations from a pretty conservative and time-varying natural rate.  Given such a loss function, the staff analysis shows clear value in strengthening our forward guidance.  I agree with President Rosengren very much. There are also considerations not captured by the staff analysis that I think add to the case for further accommodation.  Some of this came up yesterday.  The longer we go with very high unemployment and output far below its potential, the more we risk actually eroding that potential.  President Williams mentioned the supply effects the Japanese perceive.  Some of the reductions that we have already made to our estimates of potential are due to decreased capital deepening that is actually a fallout of weak demand suppressing capital investment. Mr. Chairman, your speeches have highlighted the corrosive effects of long-term unemployment, and Governor Tarullo did a great job of explaining how we may be on the cusp of finally significantly raising the natural rate of unemployment.  I think those considerations add some urgency to this situation. In favoring more policy accommodation in the form of certain variations of alternative A, I expect that I will be outside the consensus policy decision today.  Since July 2010, I’ve advocated aggressive forms of additional policy accommodation.  I argued for state-contingent price-level targeting in the fall of 2010.  I was pleased to support QE2 as a further substantial step along the way, and I hoped that that would be enough.  In August of this year, I argued for a version of the trigger threshold strategy similar to the language in alt A1, paragraph 4″.  Yesterday’s discussion clearly indicates that, at least for now, I’m outside of the Committee’s consensus regarding such policy clarifications of our “mid-2013” forward guidance—that is, if in fact there is a consensus regarding interpreting and clarifying “mid-2013.”  We’re going to have to deal with that soon.  It’s not really optional. In any event, it’s my judgment that we need another substantial step toward additional accommodation in order to solidify expectations.  Accordingly, I favor alternative A1, with a variation of paragraph 4″ included.  I think that our exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate, at least as long as the unemployment rate exceeds 7 percent or unless medium-term PCE inflation exceeds 3 percent and longer-term inflation expectations become unanchored.  Just to be clear, my preferred strategy for delivering additional accommodation in the most credible fashion would be to pursue additional asset purchases regularly at subsequent meetings until the outlook for hitting either of these thresholds increased commensurately with these additional actions. As I said, Mr. Chairman, on the basis of yesterday’s commentaries, I expect that my policy position is simply too far outside the consensus, and I cannot support alternative B today.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Evans, is arguing for further actions and additional accommodation by the Committee, while acknowledging that his position may be outside the consensus.


Passage number 211.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Can I ask a clarifying question. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: This passage does not seem to contain any obvious contention or disagreement. The request to ask a clarifying question and addressing the Vice Chairman does not inherently signify any disagreement.


Passage number 212.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  President Evans, in buying more assets, do you have a preference in terms of what you would buy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 213.
  MR. EVANS.  I would clearly support MBS.  I think that that would be very helpful for the housing market.  And I also would say that if a consensus was to emerge—which I am not anticipating—that some sort of asset purchasing today could be adopted, then I could be prepared to support that. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

In the passage, Mr. Evans expresses his support for MBS (mortgage-backed securities) and potentially supporting some sort of asset purchasing. There is no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 214.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’m going to support alternative B.  I do not support alternative A2 because I don’t favor additional asset purchases at this time.  But I do have to express some sympathy for alternative A1, with its policy thrust of pushing the funds rate guidance further out to 2014. My own forecast projects a funds rate near zero at least through mid-2014.  Considering the language options for paragraph 4 of alternative A1, I am sympathetic to the first option because, as I said, it reflects my forecast.  I’m also sympathetic to the second option for paragraph 4 because, in my view, it makes sense to move in the direction of policy conditionality in terms of projected economic outcomes, versus guidance based only on a calendar date.  I am less sympathetic to the third option in paragraph 4 because I think its introduction of an explicit unemployment threshold could prove to be a step too far.  For reasons that I expressed yesterday, I am concerned that the unemployment problem is multifaceted, not well understood, and quite possibly not as responsive as we might hope to a sustained accommodative monetary policy stance.  I am reluctant to connect the path of policy so concretely to what might show itself as time passes to be a problematic number that is taken as a trigger.  Despite my sympathy for alternative A1, paragraphs 4 and 4′, I lean to alternative B at this meeting.  I would prefer a “stay the course” approach for the time being.  The economy is improving, and I think we would be prudent to take a breather and see how the European and congressional fiscal stories play out and the economy evolves.   I think it would be best to avoid the impression of a policy change, and the easiest way to do that is to stick with our previous language.  I say this because I do not really think the presumption of a very low funds rate through mid-2014 is a change from the consensus view that has prevailed since August.  Because alternative A1, with the first paragraph 4 option, does reflect this reality, I do not strongly object to it in substance but advise against it at this meeting as a matter of tactics.  If the Committee goes in that direction, I would hope we might convey that pushing the horizon of the current funds rate policy to mid-2014 is more an extension and continuation of the August policy decision than a change in the implied degree of stimulus relative to September.  This could perhaps be done through the Chairman’s comments on the SEP. As regards the language of alternative B, I prefer no change at this meeting.  As I already implied, I do not object strenuously to the change that comes off a date and allows a rolling approach.  It does suggest an extension, as I said, which is consistent with my forecast, but that may be too narrow a point.  It’s early enough, it seems to me, to treat this tactically at this meeting.  So all things considered, I prefer the existing “mid-2013” language.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Did you want to say anything about “significant”.  Were your comments meant to encompass that or not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses sympathy towards alternative A1 but ultimately leans towards alternative B and a "stay the course" approach. They do not strongly object to alternative A1 in substance but advise against it as a matter of tactics. The speaker also prefers no change to the language of alternative B.


Passage number 215.
 MR. LOCKHART.  The dropping of “significant” is okay with me, I think, at this time because of the slight improvement in the economy. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Pianalto. MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B today.  Since our last meeting, we received some good news on the economy that signals a reduced chance of recession.  But as I said yesterday, the news hasn’t been sufficient to change my view of the most likely path of the economy, which is for slow growth in the 2½ to 2¾ percent range through 2014.  We also had a bit of good news on inflation, although not enough to be certain that we are seeing a reduction in the underlying trend of prices.  Nonetheless, I continue, as I said yesterday, to expect inflation of about 2 percent for the next few years.  With my outlook little changed since we eased policy at our last meeting, it makes sense to me to keep policy unchanged at this meeting. As we move forward, I think the course of policy is going to be highly dependent on how the considerable risks to the outlook play out.  While the risks don’t look as dire today as they did at our last meeting, they may yet pose some challenges for policy.  For example, we could easily face circumstances in which risks to price stability prevent us from easing in response to a faltering recovery or circumstances in which rising inflation prevents us from maintaining the current degree of policy accommodation in response to a still-weak recovery. In terms of the language, I wouldn’t change the “mid-2013” date at this meeting.  In paragraphs 1 and 2 of alternative B, we are making comments that show somewhat improved economic conditions, and we didn’t really change our economic outlook very much since our last meeting.  Drawing on yesterday’s discussion of policy frameworks, though, I would prefer to use the SEP to clarify the forward guidance in alternative B by referring to our forecast for unemployment and inflation in mid-2013.  Adding some form of the language in the last sentence in paragraph 4′ in alternative A1, I think, could help the public better understand our reaction function. Mr. Chairman, because you’re going to have a press conference after this meeting, I would encourage you to use that opportunity to draw the public’s attention to what we expect economic conditions are going to be in 2013, if we don’t use that language in our statement today.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speakers are expressing their individual opinions and discussing their outlook on the economy, but they are not contradicting or disagreeing with each other.


Passage number 216.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll be brief.  I support alternative B.  The data have been somewhat stronger than expected.  The recession scare that was around during the August time frame has been mitigated, at least for now. It’s true that sentiment is down at both the household level and the firm level.  I consider this a headline phenomenon for right now.  There is very real risk to the U.S. from Europe, but it’s only a risk at this point, and it’s not enough to change household behavior or business behavior for a couple of reasons.  The households, I think, see themselves as too far removed from Europe to actually change behavior, despite the fact that they’re reporting bad feelings.  For the large businesses, they’re also worried about developments in Europe, but they are also profitable and cash rich.  Their business growth strategies are not centered in Europe but in Asia, and Asian growth is projected to continue unabated.  These are two good reasons to think that the sentiment numbers are not affecting actual household and business behavior in the U.S. at this point, and so I think that that helps explain why we’re not getting significant downturn based on sentiment alone. The Committee has taken easing actions at the August and September meetings, strengthening the commitment to maintain the policy rate near zero and undertaking Operation Twist.  Both of these are operating today.  Given the improved hard data on the economy, I counsel patience at this point. I also counsel against the use of the word “significant” in paragraph 2 of alternative B.  The tradition of central bankers is to be appropriately fair but understated to avoid frightening the financial markets.  It’s a serious problem.  They think that we know something that they don’t know, and we have to be very careful about sending any signals of that nature.  I think it’s fine as originally written:  “Moreover, there are downside risks to the economic outlook, including strains in global financial markets.”  Certainly there are.  Everyone knows what we’re talking about.  Putting “significant” in there may otherwise create more problems than it solves.  So I would use the original wording in paragraph 2. If the Committee wishes to ease aggressively at future meetings, I suggest that asset purchases are the most potent tool available to the Committee.  Partly based on the discussion yesterday, I would recommend the incremental balance sheet policies, such as those described in the excellent memo of October 24 by Dave Reifschneider, John Roberts, and Jae Sim.  We haven’t discussed that memo very much at this meeting, but I thought it was very good, and I recommend that we take a look at it.  I’ve also described my own views on this issue in previous discussions with the Committee.  An incremental approach would have a great advantage of allowing the Committee to make decisions in a manner analogous to interest rate decisions in ordinary times.  Also, the open-ended nature of this approach potentially promises substantial additional easing while still giving the Committee the ability to pause or reverse the policy as the macroeconomic situation changes.  I counsel purchasing Treasuries versus MBS. Other methods of easing did not strike me as being nearly as effective as they are sometimes portrayed, partly for the reasons I outlined yesterday.  The trigger strategy approach seems questionable to me.  I do not see why this is a good way to commit to longer periods of zero rates relative to other methods of committing to longer periods of zero rates.  I do not think much would happen initially if we took this approach, and it might complicate our strategies down the line if either or both of the thresholds were violated.  Furthermore, trying to tie monetary policy directly to unemployment strikes me as very questionable given the state of knowledge of hysteresis in unemployment as experienced in Europe in recent decades.  It’s not that we shouldn’t think about unemployment—we should think about unemployment.  The question is, should you tie the policy lever directly to a number that we probably don’t understand as well as we would like to understand.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. The speaker expresses their support for alternative B and provides reasons for their stance. They also make recommendations and provide their opinion on certain strategies. However, there is no indication of disagreement or debate with others.


Passage number 217.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Mr. Chairman.  Sorry. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply mentions "President Kocherlakota" without any conflicting statements or opposing views.


Passage number 218.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I want to clarify something in my own mind.  The word “significant” was in the September FOMC statement, right. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply wants to clarify a point in his own mind by asking a question and confirming his understanding.


Passage number 219.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  So taking it out is a change from the September FOMC statement. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That’s correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply confirms a fact.


Passage number 220.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Okay.  Just to be clear. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The sentence is reoriented a little bit so that it’s not quite so obvious, but yes, it is in fact the case, and the September statement is, of course, at the beginning of your handout.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that the sentence is reoriented and confirms that the September statement is at the beginning of the handout. There is no contention or disagreement presented.


Passage number 221.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thanks. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Kocherlakota, is expressing gratitude to President Plosser.


Passage number 222.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  A week and a half ago, I gave a speech in which I suggested that additional purchases of mortgage-backed securities should be put back on the top of our agenda.  I carefully phrased that speech and that particular suggestion so as to say that if things did not improve over the next couple of months, I thought we should consider it.  I qualified the formulation, really out of respect for the decisionmaking process of the Committee.  In fact, I think that there is a good case to be made right now for additional MBS purchases. Before I get to that reasoning, though, I wanted to say a couple of things about the general environment in which we’re making this decision today.  First, we’re not just talking about unemployment here.  Had it been a circumstance in which the economy was growing 3½ percent a year but unemployment was remaining stubbornly high, it would have been one thing.  But that is not the circumstance that we confront.  We have now had a several-year pattern of growth that has little spurts and then reverts back to a very tepid pace.  So the failure to create more jobs seems quite logically tied to the performance of the economy as a whole.  Of course, there are some uncertainties about exactly how some sectors of the labor market would or would not react to improved growth.  But if one looks at the data, the importance of aggregate demand and of cyclical unemployment as explanatory variables is as strong as virtually anything that we look at in this Committee.  So I do think it’s a red herring to talk about structural unemployment or drug problems or something of the sort when we’re talking about what impact may be had by further monetary stimulus.  I appreciate Jeff’s formulation, which was basically saying, “Yes, of course there’s room for more stimulus.”  But Jeff assesses the risks of inflation versus the stimulus, and I think that’s a legitimate conversation.  I would come out on the other side, but it does seem to me that’s the conversation we should be having. I think the case is actually quite strong, and it’s quite strong right now.  Why MBS.  Well, people have already mentioned several of the reasons.  The spreads are obviously one of those reasons and the fact that we’re getting to the point where there may be some impact on market functioning of further Treasury purchases.  But I would also point to something that has been reflected in a number of your comments over the past couple of days—that the suboptimal, subexpected performance of the economy over the past few years, with the very disappointing trajectory of the recovery, seems in retrospect pretty obviously tied to debt overhang, the Reinhart–Rogoff kinds of factors that people have been citing for a while now.  And the housing sector is clearly at the center of all of that.  As Betsy was indicating, in other areas there’s been a good bit of working down of debt.  Housing is what has continued to be dysfunctional.  That’s where the debt is; that’s where the failure of markets to clear is.  Again, as Betsy was just mentioning, that’s where prices and quantities don’t quite seem to be in the kind of equilibrium that we would expect.  So I think action we would take in the housing area with MBS purchases would not only be efficacious in the way that all large-scale, long-term asset purchases would be, but could also have a particular impact on the major impediment to the kind of recovery that would more resemble past recoveries out of recessions. I know that a lot of people, myself included, are frustrated with the failure of the political branches of government to take appropriate action to provide more clarity and stimulus for the economy.  But this is an instance in which there could be some synergy.  Some modest steps have already been taken to make refinancing more readily available.  If we were to act by announcing a large-scale asset purchase, I think both the public sector and the banks themselves would see more opportunities again to leverage what we were doing to have a greater economic impact. So the case is actually quite strong, and thus I’m very much tempted to join President Evans in dissenting from alternative B, because I think alternative B does not accurately reflect the state of the economy.  Having said that, I believe there are a couple of reasons not to move right now.  One is the point that Narayana and John made earlier, and which Bill Dudley has made, I think, on a number of occasions in the past several meetings—that we do need to get the communications and the framework and the sense that we think in terms of multiple meetings (and not just one meeting) more clear than we have.  And there are some reasonable grounds for arguing that an action by us today, whether it was A1 or A2, would once again be difficult for markets and other observers fully to comprehend.  They wouldn’t quite know how it was that we were making decisions and why. Second, and someone alluded to this earlier also, I do think that the risks of a significant adverse event in Europe are as high as they have been since May 2010.  The risks are not just significant—whatever the adjective above “significant” is, that’s the one we should have.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is presenting their own thoughts and opinions in a clear and logical manner.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 223.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  “Very significant.” PARTICIPANT.  “Humongous.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. This can be inferred from the contrasting words used by Mr. Kocherlakota ("very significant") and the participant ("humongous"). They both have different opinions about the size or importance of something.


Passage number 224.
”  [Laughter] MR. TARULLO.  “Humongous”—that’s the one that belongs in the statement as an actual reflection of reality.  Because of the increased possibility of something seriously adverse happening, it might be prudent to withhold for now a significant additional policy initiative, which is what I might otherwise favor, and then to assess the state of our communications, the state of the economy, and the state of Europe over the next couple of meetings. So with considerable reluctance, I can support alternative B today.  Mr. Chairman, one probably shouldn’t make one’s support or nonsupport based on any single word, except maybe the insertion or omission of “not” in certain places.  [Laughter]  But I do think that omitting “significant,” given that it’s in the statement now and given what I regard as the increase in financial risk since the last meeting, would be a mistake.  Thanks.CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Raskin. MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Some of the incoming data indicate that the downside risks have receded somewhat.  But unemployment is still projected to decline only gradually, and inflation is still projected to settle at or below mandate-consistent levels.  The economy is still in dire straits, with sentiment highly pessimistic.  Again, I am not optimistic that households, many of which have lower levels of disposable income, are yet ready to be an engine of growth for this economy.  We have not fallen off the cliff, but the margin of safety is not wide.  Downside risk is significant. First, I think that early cessation of the maturity extension program, as suggested in alternative C, would be premature.  It also would challenge the credibility of the Committee to reverse a decision so quickly when economic indicators have not materially changed.  In my view, early cessation of the maturity extension program requires more-definitive data confirming that the recovery has strengthened and that unemployment has begun to decline. I’m instinctively drawn to alternative A1 because, with the federal funds rate constrained by the zero lower bound and with elevated downside risks to output, stronger forward guidance seems prudent.  But stronger forward guidance of any type requires a communication strategy in order to be effective.  In order to maximize the benefits of accommodation promised by such stronger forward guidance, I’d like to understand what communication efforts would accompany such an action.  Once these communication plans are developed and considered, the option in alternative A1 will be more credible to the public.  Until then, staying the course, as in alternative B, seems appropriate.  But I am drawn to the need to update our reaction function in paragraph 4 by reflecting the “six to seven quarters” language, which I think is more commensurate with at least my economic outlook.  I’m sensitive to President Kocherlakota’s argument that keeping the “through mid-2013” language reduces the level of accommodation.  So I look forward to the work of the subcommittee on communications to create for the full Committee’s consideration a framework for enhanced forward guidance. Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 225.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you.  First, I want to talk a little bit about the “significant” point.  I feel really strongly that it has to stay in, because if you take it out, you’re basically saying that you now think the downside risks are insignificant.  Does anyone around the room think that the downside risks are now insignificant.  I agree that we were surprised by the reaction of the markets last time to putting “significant” in.  But it’s very different keeping it in as opposed to taking it out.  If you’re taking it out, you’re trying to make a statement that you think the risks have really declined significantly.   I just don’t see any evidence that the downside risks have declined significantly—in fact, at all.  The European situation is probably at the worst place that it’s been.  It’s also completely inconsistent with what we’re saying in the SEPs.  If you look at the SEP results, uncertainty about GDP growth went up compared with June; downside risks to GDP growth are the same as June—11 versus 6.  If you look at the risks to unemployment, they have gone up since June.  So how do you reconcile taking “significant” out here, and then you have all of this uncertainty that you’re going to discuss in the SEP results.  I just don’t see the benefit.  I think it could be really embarrassing for the Committee if you take it out, Europe falls apart, and people go back and say, “Well, what were you thinking.  Didn’t you see what was going on in Europe as you were going into the meeting.” Now, in terms of other things, obviously I’m going to support alternative B.  I prefer to stick with the date rather than move to the quarters.  I understand the argument for the quarters, but we’re on a trajectory here where we’re hoping—at least some of us around the table are hoping—that by January we can arrive at a framework where we actually specify triggers or thresholds.  And in that case, the thresholds will be the key thing, and then the date will follow from that.  I don’t think it really makes sense to go to quarters and then go to this new thing—you’re going in a zigzag pattern.  So I don’t really oppose the idea of the quarters conceptually, but I don’t think it really fits in, in terms of the trajectory of how we might like to move through the meetings.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It primarily consists of the speaker expressing their opinion and reasoning.


Passage number 226.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Could I just say one thing to that, Bill.  For this meeting, I understand the arguments for staying the same as we were, and I appreciate that.  But even if you’re thinking about alternative A1 down the road, in December or January, we will have to communicate information about timing in some way.  And I think saying something about the duration, as opposed to a date, would be a better way, even in that context.  So I don’t think of them as being inconsistent.  That’s all I would say.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges and appreciates the arguments for staying the same, but also suggests a different approach for communicating information in the future. However, they do not express any disagreement or contention with the previous statements.


Passage number 227.
 MR. ENGLISH.  I’m sorry, but I wanted to suggest one possibility because the response was so divided, which was to use exactly the words from last time rather than changing the structure of the sentence.  It might be that the market would be less likely to notice and think about the word “significant” if it’s in the context of exactly the same words as used before. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think that’s right.  I would say the two options are, in alternative B, either striking the bracketed word “significant” and leaving the sentence as it is:  “Moreover, downside risks to the economic outlook remain, including strains in global financial markets”—I think the case for doing that is, first, there’s this mysterious overinterpretation of the word in the markets, and we’re not quite sure what all that means.  But more substantively, even though Europe remains very troubled, there has been at least a little reduction in downside risk in the near-term U.S. economic data.  The case on the other side is that we have already used this language.  And as the Vice Chairman and Governor Tarullo and others point out, we are facing downside risks that could be significant or worse from European developments.  Frankly, I’m willing to go either way.  I think if we do retain “significant,” we ought to go back just to the language of September, so there’s no need to change. PARTICIPANT.  I agree with that.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The participants are discussing two options and expressing their willingness to go either way.


Passage number 228.
  MR. LACKER.  I found Vice Chairman Dudley compelling, so I agree we should leave it in.  Going back to the old language makes sense. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker clearly expresses agreement with Vice Chairman Dudley's suggestion to leave something in and going back to the old language.


Passage number 229.
 MR. BULLARD.  Yes, I agree—we could just keep it the way it was.  Let me just say, though, that as a matter of style, you always want to be understated as a central bank.  People are imputing that we have some really detailed knowledge about what’s going to happen or that we have a special crystal ball, and they’re imputing the probability of disaster to be higher than it otherwise is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 230.
   MR. LACKER.  You could say “somewhat significant.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is providing a response and using the phrase "somewhat significant" to qualify the level of significance.


Passage number 231.
”  [Laughter] MR. BULLARD.  I’m happy to leave the sentence the way it is, but let me just say, the Wall Street Journal is a master of understatement.  They have the small headlines.  It says, “Nixon Resigns; Ford Takes the Oath of Office.”  They don’t blare it at you the way the other newspapers do.  I think that’s the style that we should have in describing the situation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 232.
 MR. FISHER.  So you would caution against “humongous”.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. The speaker, Mr. Fisher, is asking a question and seeking advice or caution. There is no indication of disagreement or contention in this statement alone.


Passage number 233.
 MR. BULLARD.  I would caution against “humongous.” CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Now, on the other side of that, “significant” is not exactly a word that would blow most people away.  [Laughter]  It is significant, certainly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Bullard is expressing his opinion and offering a cautionary statement, but there is no opposing viewpoint expressed.


Passage number 234.
 MR. LACKER.  “Notable”. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  “Significant.”  [Laughter]  I’m not suggesting any change.  All right.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The laughter after the words "Notable" and "Significant" suggests that Mr. Lacker's comment is intended to be humorous rather than expressing disagreement or contention. Additionally, Mr. Lacker explicitly states that he is not suggesting any change, further indicating that there is no disagreement.


Passage number 235.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Just a comment.  It’s fine to leave as in the original sentence.  However, in listening to what people said about “significant,” in some sense, the significant risk domestically, as you point out, has actually mitigated somewhat.  What is really true about the risk is what’s going to happen in Europe.  Being more specific—that is the source of the significant risk, rather than being something else—would be clearer in some way about what we’re saying.  So that’s just a thought, maybe, for the future.  Or maybe instead of saying “including global financial,” we could say “particularly from global financial markets.”  But I don’t want to gum up the works.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply offering a suggestion or comment on how to improve or clarify the wording of a statement.


Passage number 236.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I think this is a really great question.  You really don’t want to point fingers.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses agreement and appreciation for the question presented and advises against blaming or accusing others.
