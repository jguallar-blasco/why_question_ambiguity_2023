Passage number 1.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Brian, I’d like to get more clarification on your discussion of the breakevens and probabilities of deflation.  A number of things are going on here, clearly.  There are the effects of declining projections of real growth, perhaps, and a lot of evidence of flight to quality from Europe into safe Treasury securities, all of which potentially confuse the signals on the breakevens here and how we think about them.  So can you talk more about that—what you really believe these changes in the breakevens might be signaling and how we can decompose that, if at all.  And I would ask another question about the probabilities of deflation that have arisen from the TIPS.  If I go to, for example, our SPF surveys, those probabilities really haven’t changed that much.  They’re still much closer to 10 percent than to the 20 percent in the TIPS, which suggests to me there’s some differential here.  I’d like to hear you talk more about those effects and the interpretations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 2.
 MR. SACK.  Certainly.  I think those are very good points.  As always, we want to look at these market indicators of inflation expectations and inflation risks as having some noise, and we want to look at the collective evidence on inflation expectations, clearly.  And in the current circumstances, there are some factors that could be contributing to the downward movement in the breakeven inflation rates.  You mentioned the flight to quality as one possibility, which I think is important, and another one that’s been discussed is the expectations of the maturity extension program.  If it would be concentrated in nominal securities, the perception is that it could also be contributing to the downward movement.  Having said that, it’s moving down pretty aggressively.  It’s moving down at a time when markets in general are becoming more concerned about growth.  I think to some extent, this likely does reflect some shift in the fundamental perspectives about inflation risks.  And lastly, I’ll just comment that you’re correct that the survey evidence generally suggests a more stable outlook for inflation expectations and inflation risks, but we’ve generally found that the surveys often demonstrate more stability than we think perhaps represents the true views on risks.  So maybe we want to look at the evidence as somewhere in between the surveys and the market-based measures.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges and agrees with the points made by the other person and offers an additional perspective. They also mention that survey evidence often shows more stability than what is believed to be the true views on risks, suggesting that both sources of information should be considered.


Passage number 3.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Can I ask a follow-up question, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The Vice Chairman is given permission to ask a follow-up question by the Chairman.


Passage number 4.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  How about if we look at the TIPS market itself.  You have TIPS yields in terms of the probability of deflation within a TIP that’s already booked a bunch of inflation versus a newer one.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not present any disagreement or contention. It is simply presenting a suggestion to consider looking at the TIPS market and comparing TIPS yields in terms of deflation probability for different TIPS.


Passage number 5.
 MR. SACK.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: The answer is yes. Without any further information about the context, it is not possible to determine the exact subject of contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 6.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  What does that show.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This question is asking for an interpretation or analysis rather than presenting any kind of argument or disagreement.


Passage number 7.
 MR. SACK.  Well, that’s what the measure in the bottom right is.  That’s a very good point.  It wouldn’t be distorted by these differences.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not demonstrate any contention or disagreement. It seems to be a conversation where Mr. Sack acknowledges and agrees with a point made by someone else.


Passage number 8.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  That shouldn’t be distorted by liquidity and things of that sort.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is expressing an opinion that certain factors, such as liquidity, should not distort something.


Passage number 9.
 MR. SACK.  That’s right.  I think for the measure in the bottom right, distortion to the implied deflation is less of a concern.  Probably for the five-year, five-year forward breakeven rate, some of the considerations you raised are relevant, though.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply acknowledges that some of the considerations raised by the other person are relevant for the five-year, five-year forward breakeven rate.


Passage number 10.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "Thank you" and "President Lacker" are simply expressions of gratitude and a mention of the name of the subject.


Passage number 11.
 MR. LACKER.  Excuse me.  Could you explain how this is taken out of the TIPS.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 12.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Well, you have some TIPS securities that have been outstanding for a while, and there’s a bunch of inflation that’s accrued, and so if you get deflation from here, that still gets embedded in the price—you give back that inflation that you’ve achieved because it’s been outstanding for a while.  But if a new TIP has just been issued, you have deflation from here; you don’t have to give that back.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes.

Explanation: The passage presents two different scenarios - one where TIPS securities have been outstanding for a while and another where a new TIP has just been issued. In the first scenario, there is a contention or disagreement because it is stated that if there is deflation from that point onward, the inflation accrued over time would have to be given back. In the second scenario, it is stated that in the case of deflation, there is no need to give back any inflation because the TIP is new. This implies a disagreement or different outcomes in these two situations.


Passage number 13.
 MR. LACKER.  I’ve got you.  It’s a different basis.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is clarifying a point made by someone else, indicating understanding and agreement.


Passage number 14.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes, exactly. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The response "Yes, exactly" indicates agreement or confirmation. The mention of President Fisher does not suggest any disagreement.


Passage number 15.
 MR. FISHER.  This is just a comment, Mr. Chairman, but you gave a speech in October 2003, which was titled “Monetary Policy and the Stock Market:  Some Empirical Results,” and you spoke of how—and I loved the particular word that you used because it had such emotion to it—the market “quivers” as they await the FOMC’s decision.  And you concluded, obviously, that FOMC decisions can move markets.  I’m interested, in listening to Brian today and the past many, many reports we’ve had—really, beginning with your third slide, you talked about the market’s anticipation of our lengthening of duration.  So we’ve moved from the meeting itself to expectations of what we’d accomplish at the meeting, which are oddly correlated with what we’re actually contemplating.  And we might be tempted to conclude that these quivers, or whatever you might call them, would then lead to tremors if we don’t act according to what the market’s expecting. I guess the question I have is, is there a way we can better understand this.  There’s an uncanny resemblance, as I said earlier, to what we’re actually discussing and what markets are thinking about, and then we are tempted, perhaps, to live in fear that if we don’t deliver according to market expectations, we’ll have a very harsh reaction.  In other words, markets are anticipating quivering before we act rather than upon our action, as you articulated so well in 2003.  I don’t think things have changed that much since 2003.  There’s more information, the net is much more thorough, we have more market operators, et cetera, but something is amiss here.  And I wonder if we could at least think about that.  Maybe the Board staff or a group of us could form a committee to get a better feeling for how this is happening, what it means, and whether it is affecting the way we make decisions.  Because I’m concerned about that—and this isn’t a criticism of you, you’re just reporting what you’re finding in the marketplace—from slide 3 onward to the very last one.  That’s one point.  The second point—and it’s most un-central-bank-like, it’s un-Bagehot-like—is that they’re expecting us to move into assets that everybody else is demanding right now—until you got to your mortgage-backed security slide.  Those are just observations, but I’m very concerned that we might be influenced by market expectations.  I’m not sure how those market expectations are built, but things have progressed a little bit, Mr. Chairman, since that speech in October 2003, which I thought, for the record, was a very good speech. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thanks.  First of all, I think we all agree that the FOMC makes policy based on our economic outlook, and the markets have to adapt to that.  There’s a bit of an observational equivalence, though, between markets in some sense forcing policy actions and markets simply receiving good communication.  We have become more transparent in the past eight years or so.  Our minutes, for example, have been a big source of information.  I recall very well the debates we had about moving the minutes, which used to be after the subsequent meeting, into the intermeeting period.  Of course, the minutes describe the options and the discussion, and so I think that would be one mechanism.  I take your point, and would emphasize that as conditions warrant, we need to act appropriately, but I do think part of it, at least, is coming from us guiding the markets in various ways in terms of what to anticipate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a discussion about the relationship between market expectations and the actions of the FOMC.


Passage number 16.
 MR. FISHER.  Or transparency. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  And to the extent that that’s true, it’s a sign of success that we are transparent and communicating effectively.  Other questions.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a statement about the success of being transparent and communicating effectively.


Passage number 17.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  If I could amplify on your remarks—because I used to do this—I would comment that basically the people in the market are trying to think along with the Fed.  They’re trying to think, “Well, if I were in their shoes, what would I do.”  And I believe this has been the case for many years.  It’s just a little bit more vivid now because we’re engaged in using policy instruments that we haven’t used historically, but believe me, for the past 20 years, people have been thinking very hard about, “Is the Fed going to move at this meeting.  If they’re going to move, how much are they going to move.”  And that’s all been priced in.  I completely accept your point that at the end of the day, we have to do what is appropriate, not just because the market has priced it in.  But regarding the convergence of the marketplace and our actions, I don’t think it’s surprising in the sense that the market is observing us and learning from us and solving for what our reaction function is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any explicit contention or disagreement. The speaker is providing additional commentary and agreeing with the other person's point while also offering their perspective on the convergence of the marketplace and the Fed's actions.


Passage number 18.
 MR. FISHER.  Again, because both of us used to do this for a living, I think you’re right.  I think what the Chairman said is most important.  We let what is in the best interest of the real economy guide us, not what the markets expect us to do at any one meeting.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Other questions.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage shows agreement between Mr. Fisher and the Chairman, as they both believe it is important to prioritize the best interest of the real economy over the expectations of the markets. President Kocherlakota simply indicates that he has other questions.


Passage number 19.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Brian, I just have a quick factual question, which is, how much usage of the ECB swap lines has there been so far.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a simple question asking for a factual answer.


Passage number 20.
 MR. SACK.  Very little.  There was just over $500 million in last week’s operation from two institutions.  It’s possible that with the 84-day operation, there will be more usage.  The pricing of obtaining dollar funding for three months is actually very close to the price of the swap line.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention any disagreement or contention. It simply states the amount of money in a recent operation and speculates about the possibility of more usage in a future operation. It also mentions that the pricing of obtaining dollar funding for three months is close to the price of the swap line.


Passage number 21.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Oh, I see.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement is neutral and does not express any disagreement or contention. It simply indicates understanding or realization.


Passage number 22.
 MR. SACK.  Whereas the current operations are 7-day operations, most firms, even under strained market conditions, can get funding in the markets much cheaper than the pricing of the swap lines.  So we will see in mid-October if usage picks up with these new operations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage presents a statement about the current operations and funding options available in the market. It does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 23.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thanks.  That was very helpful. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Kocherlakota expresses gratitude for the assistance provided by President Lacker.


Passage number 24.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The difference between the maturity extension program and an equivalent-sized quantitative easing is that with the quantitative easing, we issue more reserves, and with the maturity extension program, we force the private sector to absorb, instead of reserves, more two-year securities.  With our policy guidance, two-year securities are trading roughly under 20 basis points, and so they seem like virtually perfect substitutes for reserves.  I’d be interested in the Desk’s insight into the differences between those two.  How much different would it be for us to force them to hold more two-year securities than it would for us to force the market to hold more reserves.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for clarification and insight into the differences between the maturity extension program and quantitative easing.


Passage number 25.
 MR. SACK.  In general, I think those are substitutes, and the staff would say that there won’t be much of a difference in the effect on markets in terms of whether reserves are issued or two-year and other short-term Treasuries are sold.  There are some differences, of course, though.  The reserves have to reside in the banking system, and the Treasuries, instead, can be more broadly held.  So to the extent that leverage ratios matter or other bank-specific behavior matters, you do have a difference there.  But I think we would agree with the broad sense of your question.  We see the mechanisms of maturity extension or asset purchase programs as being similar, with the effect coming more from the assets that are purchased than from the way they’re sterilized or whether they create reserves or two-year Treasuries. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It’s a nice test of the two different theories of balance sheet expansion.  Is it reserves or is it the asset side.  Governor Raskin. MS. RASKIN.  Yes.  Just a question, Brian, regarding the New York policy survey.  In terms of the probabilities of additional policy actions, we are seeing a relatively high probability on providing SOMA guidance, and I was wondering if you could talk about your sense of what the participants in this survey are looking for.  I think you said that they seem to be looking for explicit guidance on the path of the balance sheet, but of course, we’ve put out principles regarding how we would conduct an exit strategy.  So my question is whether you can shed any light on what else they seem to be looking for.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The two speakers seem to agree on the main points being discussed.


Passage number 26.
 MR. SACK.  Some respondents just think it’s a simple and logical step to put more of that guidance into the FOMC statement.  The FOMC statement right now obviously has very strong guidance on one policy instrument and virtually none on the other, if you consider the other to be the balance sheet.  Having said that, I completely agree that with the exit strategy that the minutes have laid out, the guidance on the short rate is, in effect, providing them with guidance on the balance sheet.  So that may limit the effectiveness of this step, but I think respondents to the survey just see it as a logical step and maybe one that could have at least some beneficial effect. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions for Brian.  [No response]  All right.  We need to vote to ratify domestic open market operations since the last meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker agrees with the idea of putting more guidance on the balance sheet into the FOMC statement, but also acknowledges that the guidance on the short rate already indirectly provides guidance on the balance sheet.


Passage number 27.
 MR. CARPENTER.  Thank you.  The Committee also received a memo about the implications of lowering the interest rate paid on excess reserves (what we refer to as the IOER rate) to zero or to some positive value, such as 10 basis points.  I should note that I’m referring to what’s labeled “Exhibit 2.”  It’s a set of bullet points to help you follow along.  Lowering the IOER rate would likely push down money market rates and, by lowering the expected future short-term rate, should also put some downward pressure on longer-term interest rates.  The overall effect would likely be quite modest, however, because money market rates are already near zero, and there are some impediments to some of these interest rates falling below zero.  For example, it is unlikely that the federal funds rate would ever trade at negative rates; however, other instruments, such as Eurodollars, GC repo, and Treasury bills, have traded at negative rates in the past and could do so in the future. Lowering the IOER rate should, all else being equal, provide banks with an additional incentive to lend, because any individual bank could fund additional lending by running down its reserves and leaving the overall size of its balance sheet unchanged.  However, surveys over the past couple of years suggest that banks see a paucity of qualified borrowers, so a modest reduction in their opportunity cost of lending may have only modest effects on their overall quantity of lending. Lowering the IOER rate might also mitigate the reputational risk to the Federal Reserve from the appearance of paying a subsidy to banks.  That risk may be heightened because the rise in reserve balances that came from the LSAP program initiated in November 2010 has been concentrated at branches and agencies of foreign banks and because, since the spring, with the adjustment in the FDIC’s insurance assessment, market rates have fallen further below the IOER rate.  Reducing the IOER rate to zero would clearly eliminate any possible subsidy.  Reducing the IOER rate to 10 basis points would at least result in the Federal Reserve paying interest to banks at a rate that is somewhat more in line with other safe, short-term assets. Of course, reducing the IOER rate, particularly to zero, has potential costs, including disruptions to money markets and the intermediation of credit.  If short-term interest rates decline further, money market funds could come under additional pressure, and the industry would likely contract further.  The large volumes of funds intermediated though money market funds might have to be redirected, with the ultimate investors potentially switching to other assets and the ultimate borrowers finding alternative sources of funding.  If such shifts were abrupt, and borrowers could not find ready alternative sources of funding, disruptions to market functioning could ensue. There could be, in particular, implications for the federal funds market as well.  The federal funds market consists of banks borrowing from institutions that cannot earn interest on reserves, primarily the Federal Home Loan Banks, in order to arbitrage the IOER rate.  If the IOER rate were cut, especially to zero, banks would lose the incentive for this trade.  The federal funds market would likely contract significantly, and the effective rate could become erratic, perhaps becoming less well correlated with other market rates and even possibly rising outside of the target range. Investors might react to lower money market rates by leaving large deposits with their banks.  Given balance sheet pressures, other banks might follow the lead of Bank of New York Mellon and begin imposing explicit negative interest rates on deposits.  If such a pattern became widespread, policymakers might be concerned about creating hardships for households and other savers and, as a result, run a different reputational risk. Finally, the U.S. Treasury debt auctions cannot accept negative bids.  If Treasury bills were persistently trading at negative rates, bidding at auctions could be distorted, with a likely stop-out rate at 0 percent, and the primary dealers would instantly realize a risk-free profit from the Treasury.  That concludes my remarks.  I turn it over to Dave.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting information and discussing the potential effects and costs of lowering the IOER rate.


Passage number 28.
 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Thanks.  Turning to your third exhibit, one of the memos we distributed to you last week explored a variety of issues related to forward guidance.  The top panel considers one of those issues:  the market’s reaction to the additional guidance you provided in the August statement—specifically, the indication that “the Committee currently anticipates that economic conditions . . . are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.”  As noted in the first bullet, this guidance reduced the perceived odds that policy would begin tightening before mid-2013, as evidenced by a downward revision to the expected path of the funds rate implied by futures; uncertainty about the future path of the funds rate also fell.  Together, these developments led to a moderate decline in longer-term Treasury yields.  In addition, as Brian noted earlier, market commentary since the August meeting suggests that investors understand that the Committee’s forward guidance is conditional, and that the timing of the onset of tightening is not tied to a specific date but will depend on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.  That said, investors are unclear about the specific conditions that would warrant tightening.  In this regard, the latest Desk survey suggests market participants anticipate that the unemployment rate will be close to 8 percent and the inflation rate around 2 percent when you first begin to tighten—conditions that may or may not be consistent with your policy intentions. This market uncertainty about future policy suggests that you may wish to consider ways to clarify your forward guidance further, such as providing quantitative information about the conditions that would influence the decision as to when to begin tightening.  As noted in the middle panel, such clarification could better align market expectations for monetary policy with the FOMC’s intentions and reduce uncertainty about future policy actions.  If so, that guidance could be stimulative to the degree that the public currently underestimates your willingness to pursue accommodative monetary policy over the medium term.  Beyond that, such guidance could make investors’ responses to incoming data on the economy, and thus the accompanying movements in longer-term interest rates and other asset prices, more consistent with the Committee’s actual reaction function.   One way of providing more specificity about the factors influencing the Committee’s actions might be to announce specific unemployment and inflation “threshold” conditions for keeping monetary policy exceptionally accommodative.  Under this approach, the Committee could indicate its intention to keep the federal funds rate near zero at least as long as unemployment was above, say, a 7 percent threshold and the medium-term outlook for headline inflation remained below a 2½ percent threshold.  As the memo discusses, the use of threshold conditions raises a number of issues, one of them being the potential for confusion about the Committee’s long-run objectives.  To avoid such confusion, as well as to help more firmly anchor long-run inflation expectations, the Committee might also wish to release quantitative information about both its long-run inflation goal and its projection of the level to which the unemployment rate will converge over time. In addition to considering these communication issues, the memo also explored the potential benefits and costs of additional forward guidance using simulations of the FRB/US model; the bottom panel summarizes the results from this exercise.  Our analysis suggests that the Committee could potentially provide modest near-term stimulus if it committed to keeping the funds rate near zero as long as specified thresholds for unemployment and inflation were not breached.  In the simulations, the effectiveness of such guidance rests on two conditions.  First, the announced policy must be credible, in that the public must be confident that future FOMCs will follow through on that guidance.  Second, the guidance must indicate an appreciably later liftoff than currently expected by the public.  The simulation results suggest the Committee probably should not expect much additional stimulus from this strategy unless it acts fairly aggressively by, for example, announcing its intention to keep the federal funds rate very low as long as unemployment is above, say, 6½ percent and the medium-term outlook for inflation is below 2½ percent. In the simulations, forward guidance of this sort provides only modest stimulus because it alters expectations only for the likely date that policy firming will begin and not for the average stance of policy thereafter.  But the announcement of thresholds might in fact change longer-run expectations more dramatically, particularly if supplemented with guidance about the pace at which the federal funds rate will be normalized after liftoff.  If credible, such longer-term guidance could potentially yield more pronounced expectationally driven changes in financial conditions and other factors, and thus appreciably more stimulus.  Additional model simulations reported in the memo suggest that if the Committee could convince the public of its intention to pursue policies later in the decade that are only somewhat more gradualist than the public would otherwise expect, it could bring about a noticeably faster decline in unemployment than in the baseline forecast, accompanied by inflation running modestly above 2 percent for a time.  Such an outcome would be similar to the optimal policy simulation results reported in the Tealbook. The memo also considered the robustness of this sort of forward guidance to unexpected economic developments.  This analysis suggested that, while unconditional commitments to keep the federal funds rate near zero until some specified date are highly problematic, conditional forward guidance in the form of announced thresholds for unemployment and inflation appears to do reasonably well in a wide range of circumstances, including ones where policymakers significantly overestimate the amount of slack in the economy. The final page of your handout reproduces the questions that were distributed to the Committee last week.  During the go-round this morning, you may want to address these questions in the context of your remarks.  Thank you; this concludes our presentation.  We would be happy to take your questions. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much for a concise presentation of a much more detailed set of memos, which were very helpful, and I thank you for that as well.  Before we go into a go-round, let’s have a question period.  Are there any questions for the staff.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a presentation of information and suggestions for consideration.


Passage number 29.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Yes, thank you very much for a very complete set of memos.  I do have a question on the interest on excess reserves memo—probably not surprising.  After rereading your memo again this morning, I looked at the H.8 for foreign-related institutions in the United States, and the cash assets, which include reserves, were $943 billion; Treasury securities, were roughly $100 billion.  I can’t from that look at how much excess reserves are actually being held.  Do you have the percent of excess reserves actually being held at branches and agencies.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a question seeking clarification on a specific topic.


Passage number 30.
 MR. CARPENTER.  I don’t have that on me.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage because Mr. Carpenter simply states that he does not have something on him without any opposing statements or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 31.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Ballpark.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information or statements that would suggest contention or disagreement.


Passage number 32.
 MR. CARPENTER.  Yes, it’s getting up close to just under half of the total quantity.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states a fact or observation without any contradictory or opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 33.
 MR. ROSENGREN.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 34.
  Half of the excess reserves of the foreign branches— MR. CARPENTER.  Most of the roughly $600 billion increase from the second LSAPs, in dollar terms, went to the foreign branches and agencies, in an adding-up sense.  So it’s a good portion of it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 35.
 MR. ENGLISH.  On September 7, the numbers that I have show about $800 billion at the foreign DIs and about $700 billion at domestic.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states the numbers without any conflicting perspectives or opinions.


Passage number 36.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Just a second part to that question.  There’s been a big change in how foreign branches have been used in the United States.  A year ago in August, they were supplying $323 billion over to Europe or over to their parents, which is more typical.  They tend to raise funds in the United States, and send it over to their parent.  More recently, though, that’s reversed, and it was a $500 billion switch between last year and this year.  So they’re now receiving on that September 7 date $238 billion from the parent.  That’s a very big swing.  As I was trying to understand why that swing would occur—and President Lacker’s observation is relevant—I noted that three-month T-bills are paying 1 basis point; six-month T-bills, 2 basis points; and a two-year Treasury is paying 16 basis points, very close to the 20 basis points that he mentioned.  If, for example, a French bank is holding two-year Treasury securities at 20 basis points in order to be able to meet potential liquidity needs but has an option with a branch to hold reserves at 25 basis points in the United States, then it seems as though the strategy would be to sell the two-year Treasury security and put the funds in a branch getting 25 basis points.  By doing so, they get a higher return and reduce the duration risk of their portfolio, and that seems to be reducing the demand for medium-term Treasury securities because they’re choosing to hold overnight reserves paying a higher return with lower duration risk rather than holding medium-term Treasury securities.  To what extent is our holding the reserve rate so high having an impact that is counter to what we’re trying to do with medium-term Treasury securities.  Is it discouraging demand for medium-term Treasury securities, particularly by foreign banking organizations.  Do you have any observations on whether you’re seeing that kind of trend actually occurring.  And to what degree do you think that’s important.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply presenting information and asking for observations and opinions on a certain trend.


Passage number 37.
 MR. CARPENTER.  I guess I would offer the following.  The transmission channel that you described about the switch in the funding position of the branches relative to their headquarters overseas is consistent with the anecdotal reports that we are hearing.  And you can think about the reasons for this working independently and then reinforcing each other, with reserves being an attractive asset, paying more than other perfectly safe things, and the foreign supervisors wanting there to be more dollar-denominated liquidity on their books for liquidity reasons.  We’re definitely hearing that story.  I think there are a couple of different ways it could matter in terms of the effect on other market rates and intermediate-term market rates.  The story that you told where there is reduced demand for two-year Treasuries and increased demand for reserves would tend to push up the two-year rate closer to the IOER rate.  But that’s in some sense just the more general point that the rate paid on reserves affects short-term rates and things that are close substitutes.  To the extent that it’s higher than it might otherwise be, if 25 basis points is higher than zero, then presumably if the IOER rate fell to zero, the two-year rate would also come down at least to some degree with it.  Does that answer the question you were asking.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a response that explains a certain phenomenon and provides an analysis of its potential effects.


Passage number 38.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Yes.  That sounds consistent with the kind of story I was telling.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Rosengren is simply agreeing with the statement made by someone else.


Passage number 39.
 MR. CARPENTER.  I think your story is consistent with what we’ve been hearing and the data we have.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. Mr. Carpenter simply states his opinion that the story is consistent with what has been heard and the available data.


Passage number 40.
 MR. ENGLISH.  I think that’s right.  Just one other thought.  I’m not sure that the story you were telling depends on it being a foreign banking organization.  The same story would be true for a domestic organization in terms of its decision between holding Treasuries and holding reserves.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. English is simply expressing his thoughts and raising a different perspective on the story being discussed.


Passage number 41.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  You might argue, though, that the optics of paying a very high return on an overnight fund to a foreign banking organization are a little bit different.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is presenting a hypothetical argument that could be made by someone else, but they are not expressing their own disagreement or contention.


Passage number 42.
 MR. ENGLISH.  On the optics, I agree.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. English, agrees on the subject of optics.


Passage number 43.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  The optics would show, I think, paying a very substantial premium that’s higher than what they could get on a two-year.  I don’t know if people are going to be as worried about it for a domestic entity, but if it was widely understood that it was for a foreign banking organization, particularly because this is an important tool for us when we are exiting, you do wonder whether it undermines our willingness to be able to use this tool in the future if people start being concerned about what its effect is on potentially subsidizing foreign organizations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing a hypothetical concern about how the use of a certain tool might be perceived by others, specifically in relation to foreign organizations.


Passage number 44.
 MR. ENGLISH.  Just one other thought.  If you literally look at holdings of Treasury securities and straight agency debt at the foreign banks, they’ve actually been growing over the past year or so, right through August.  I think that’s consistent with what Seth said.  Some of these institutions are being urged by their supervisors to beef up their U.S. dollar liquidity, and so they may be holding both more reserves and more Treasury securities. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher, you had a two-handed intervention.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply presenting information and agreeing with a previously mentioned statement.


Passage number 45.
 MR. FISHER.  Eric’s point is very good, and I think the point about domestic banks is very good.  But I thought that under Regulation D, we couldn’t pay interest rates on bank balances that exceeded market rates.  Is that true or false.  What is the law, and what do the regulations require.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, Mr. Fisher is seeking clarification and asking for information about Regulation D and the requirements for interest rates on bank balances. There is no contention or disagreement expressed.


Passage number 46.
 MR. CARPENTER.  The statutory requirement is that the rate paid on reserves can’t exceed the general level of short-term interest rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage simply states a statutory requirement without any explicit disagreement or contention.


Passage number 47.
   MR. FISHER.  Short-term interest rates are defined as.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage is a statement of fact and does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 48.
 MR. CARPENTER.  Not defined.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The statement "Mr. Carpenter" is not defined does not propose any disagreement or contention. It simply states that there is no specific definition or explanation provided for Mr. Carpenter.


Passage number 49.
 MR. FISHER.  But Eric just laid out all the way to two years.  It must be defined somewhere.  Did we not codify this in Regulation D—was it section 204.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Fisher is asking a question and seeking clarification about the codification of a certain regulation. He does not express any disagreement or contention with Eric's statement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 50.
 MR. CARPENTER.  The statutory requirement is pretty vague.  In terms of putting things into practice, it ends up being a little bit more judgment.  You could look at several other market rates, and so you’d have to define the universe of short-term interest rates.  You’d have to define what “general level” means.  So if you were to look at just federal funds, the effective federal funds rate is 6, 7 basis points, but every day there’s a distribution of trades, and some of those trades are outside of the 0 to 25 basis points target range.  As a result, there are, every day, trades in short-term money markets that are above 25 basis points.  In that sense, it’s not obvious, at least to me, that paying 25 basis points is at odds with the vague definition of the law.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Carpenter, expresses uncertainty and raises potential issues with the implementation of the statutory requirement. He questions the definition of terms like "general level" and raises concerns about the specificity and accuracy of market rates. This signifies that there is contention or disagreement regarding the interpretation and practical application of the law.


Passage number 51.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "Thank you" by Mr. Fisher implies gratitude or appreciation and does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 52.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I had a question and a comment.  The question was about the observation that if we executed either the MEP or the LSAP, we’d be holding 40 percent of the Treasuries with maturity over six years.  To me, that suggests that these operations might not be all that scalable.  So in the sense that if we faced further deterioration in the economy and we wanted to provide more accommodation at that stage, it would be difficult for us to think about working through augmenting these programs.  Is that a fair conclusion. MS. REMACHE.  I think that would be fair to say.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a question followed by a response that agrees with the question.


Passage number 53.
 MR. SACK.  They’re not scalable in terms of purchasing in this region.  They’re also not scalable in the ability to sell securities because obviously we just have a fixed quantity at the short end of the yield curve.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact about the lack of scalability in purchasing and selling securities in the region.


Passage number 54.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thanks.  And then the comment is about how, if we were to lower the IOER, banks could begin imposing explicit negative deposit rates.  This is reminiscent of conversations I’ve had with people—they typically tend to be older people—who are complaining about the low interest rates they’re earning on their savings.  The comment that I’m tempted to make, but which I have not made yet in public, is that this is actually a feature, not a bug.  [Laughter]  We’re trying to get them to consume, as opposed to saving, to spend money on their grandkids and lend to that promising young entrepreneur down the street, as opposed to holding money, and so this actually would be a sign of the program working.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their personal thoughts about the low interest rates and their desire for people to spend and invest rather than save. There is no opposing viewpoint or conflicting perspective presented.


Passage number 55.
 MR. CARPENTER.  Right.  What we tried to characterize in the memo, and I alluded to it in the briefing, was that this would be in some sense a reputational risk.  From an economic perspective, banks have, since time immemorial, imposed fees on checking accounts, giving at least effective or implicit negative rates.  But writing down a negative interest rate as their deposit rate is psychologically different for people.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing an explanation or clarification regarding the characterization of a reputational risk and the psychological difference it would have on people.


Passage number 56.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  No, that’s fair. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions for the staff.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply suggests a fair response, followed by a request for further questions.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 57.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have two comments on exhibit 3, “Forward Guidance.”  I think one aspect of these simulations is that the announcement inside the model to keep rates low for longer is assumed to be a credible announcement, as you note here, and I’m not sure that that’s really the right way to think about this.  You’re talking about a central bank that has never done this in the past and an unprecedented situation.  You make an announcement far out into the future—say, for 2015—and my baseline would be that the market’s not initially going to believe that you’re going to be able to carry through on that commitment far out into the future.  That is, when you actually get to 2015, you’ll be tempted to revert to normal Committee behavior as it has evolved over many years.  And so my sense is that because of this assumption, these effects are probably overstated in the simulations, and that you should allow the guys in the model to gradually learn that the Committee is actually going to come around and actually carry through on this, even if the data may come in somewhat differently than anticipated at the time of the announcement. The other area—obviously I’ve been an advocate of this—was that I was disappointed to see that simulations like this don’t take into account the possibility that you would just get stuck at a zero nominal interest rate equilibrium and you’d end up at zero nominal interest rates for a very long period of time.  Japan has been at zero for about 15 years.  I think you have to have that also in the simulation so that you can say with some confidence, “You take on this action, and you’ll be able to move off zero at some point in the future,” instead of eliciting expectations that are going to actually keep you at zero for a very long period of time.  Those are two aspects of the simulations I was disappointed with. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. Mr. Bullard expresses disagreement regarding the assumption that the announcement to keep rates low for longer is credible, as well as the lack of consideration for the possibility of being stuck at a zero nominal interest rate equilibrium for a long period of time. He believes that these aspects of the simulations are overstated and suggests alternative approaches.


Passage number 58.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  One more observation on interest on excess reserves.  I did spend some time talking to asset managers over the past month, and on the retail side, a company like Fidelity already gives you an option to sweep into an FDIC-insured account.  So for the retail, you already have an option outside of the government or the prime money market fund.  At the wholesale level, the way they described it to me is it’s like selling turkeys at Thanksgiving—you sell turkeys under cost, but you care about the fact that the entire shopping cart is full—and so they think of an account as a suite of assets that people are actually doing.  The government securities money market fund pays 1 basis point at Fidelity and roughly that at almost all the others, but they’re interested in the suite of assets that the people put in.  They need a place to park the funds.  Their indication to me was that it wouldn’t change their behavior very much.  They aren’t going to lower the rate below zero, but they do view it as a loss leader for the other services.  So I’m not sure it’s going to be quite as disruptive as the memo indicated—at least the perspective from the asset managers I talked to. And just an observation on the negative interest rate.  BONY did announce its negative interest rate.  Shortly after that, the stock price dropped, the CEO left the company, customers complained, and no other custody bank chose to follow suit.  I would say that I’ve talked to two custody banks, and they’re gleeful at the negative interest rate.  So I’m not sure that is actually a trendsetter for other organizations.  Just an observation that I’m not as worried about that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is providing their observations and personal perspective on certain topics but does not contradict or argue against any specific point.


Passage number 59.
 MR. CARPENTER.  Yes.  On the first point about the money fund, I think we agree with you entirely, and I should point out that there is a distribution across the staff as to how big the costs are.  I think the ability of a sponsor to subsidize a fund that’s operating at a loss then means either that some of the disruptions won’t happen or that the disruptions might happen more slowly through time, allowing this greater intermediation that may ultimately have to take place going from one steady state to another.  It could happen more gradually—again, mitigating the potential disruptions.  So the scenario you paint seems entirely plausible.  We just can’t be certain that that’s going to be the case. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Pianalto. MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Actually, I think President Rosengren just answered my question.  Because this idea that we might lower the interest rate on excess reserves has been in the public for some time now, I was going to ask whether the Desk or the Board staff had conversations with money market fund managers about how they viewed the effect.  And President Rosengren’s response about the managers he has talked to answers it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both speakers seem to be in general agreement with each other's points and are providing additional information or clarification.


Passage number 60.
 MR. CARPENTER.  I think from the money fund management perspective, the view that President Rosengren brings up is one that we’ve heard a lot here at the Board.  Brian, I don’t know whether you want to characterize the Desk’s discussions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate contention or disagreement. It is merely stating that President Rosengren's view is one that has been heard before at the Board.


Passage number 61.
 MR. SACK.  We did not do an extensive reach-out recently on this issue, but we always have conversations with money funds.  This has been in play for some time.  I’d just say that you do hear some anecdotes on the other side as well:  They’ve been subsidizing; if we take another 5 or 10 basis points out of returns, there’s a limit to their ability to subsidize; and at least one or two have suggested that they would close funds.  Now, it’s hard to know whether that’s a forecast or a way of trying to lean against this possibility.  I think some anecdotes say it would not be disruptive or important, but they don’t all go in that direction. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply presenting different viewpoints and anecdotes related to money funds.


Passage number 62.
 MR. FISHER.  I think that’s an important question.  I think an even more important question is whether it would induce banks to lend more.  Have we had a chance to survey banks.  Seth, you may have an answer to this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply asking a question and stating his own opinion, and then inquiring if someone else has information that can further support or address the topic.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 63.
 MR. PLOSSER.  I would suggest—and I have suggested this before—that I think this is about communications as much as anything else.  And I don’t think the statement is the place to do that.  You’ve given several speeches about why the unemployment SEP number is different.  I think that concept needs to be socialized more widely.  I think you and the Vice Chair and others need to talk about it in speeches, help explain it to the public, so they understand this means something different before we try to get our policy statement, in which we are confined to very few words, to convey that notion.  I think that over a period of time, I would certainly become more comfortable that we could do this and not have it be misinterpreted.  In the context of a policy statement, I think it’s very difficult to do. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Plosser disagrees with the idea of conveying a specific concept through the policy statement and suggests that it should be communicated through speeches instead.


Passage number 64.
 MR. LACKER.  Just an observation, Mr. Chairman.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "Just an observation, Mr. Chairman" suggests that Mr. Lacker is simply making an observation without expressing any contrary opinion or disagreement.


Passage number 65.
 MR. LACKER.  CNBC this morning aired a discussion of our possible policy tools, including this “trigger strategy” idea.  They referred to the unemployment rate trigger as a target.  So I think the discussion has begun, and I think we’re behind the curve on that if we’re going to try to convince the public that it’s not a target. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Lacker expressing his opinion about a discussion that was aired on CNBC.


Passage number 66.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  What do we mean by “target”.  Do we mean “target” as in when we think about starting to normalize policy or “target” as in a long-term objective for unemployment.  “Target” can mean different things.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The author is simply posing questions and acknowledging that the term "target" can have different interpretations or meanings.


Passage number 67.
 MR. LACKER.  I understand what we mean about it.  I’m just reporting that— CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  We understand the distinction between an inflation target and an unemployment “target” in quotation marks.  We understand that’s an important distinction to make.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating that they understand the distinction between an inflation target and an unemployment "target."


Passage number 68.
 MR. BULLARD.  Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes, Jim.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no indication of contention or disagreement in the passage. The use of "yes" by Mr. Bullard in response to the Chairman's statement suggests agreement or acknowledgement.


Passage number 69.
 MR. BULLARD.  Maybe we should just try to clarify this here.  I thought if you put your stuff in your Taylor rule, then usually you said you’re targeting those things.  Now, here we don’t have a Taylor rule, but you have this threshold for action that seems very close to me.  So I don’t know.  I think that there maybe is some confusion over the targets versus—I’m not sure what it is if it’s not a target. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That was the sense, I think, that the Vice Chairman was reacting to—that there is a u* and a π* in the Taylor rule, and in that sense, it’s an anchor for or a determinant of policy.  The difference is that we can set π*; we can’t set u*.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage describes a potential source of confusion or misunderstanding, but there is no explicit disagreement or contention present.


Passage number 70.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Absolutely. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 71.
 MR. EVANS.  Well, I remember hearing John Taylor, or maybe he wrote it down in his blog somewhere, say that he disagrees with that characterization.  Now, I don’t agree with how he described it, but at some point he said that output is only in there to capture inflationary pressures and things like that.  So there is tremendous disagreement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage states that there is disagreement between Mr. Evans and John Taylor regarding the characterization of output and its purpose being to capture inflationary pressures. While Mr. Evans and John Taylor do not agree on how they described it, their differing views indicate disagreement.


Passage number 72.
 MR. BULLARD.  Right.  I’m recalling long papers by Lars Svensson that are defining all these things, and I don’t think it was very clear. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 73.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I’ll refrain from making comments about how much CNBC has read Lars Svensson’s work.  [Laughter]  As you referred to in your framing remarks, Mr. Chairman,  I think it is important to keep in mind that the thresholds that are being used in paragraph 4 of alternative A are not u*.  They are a way to describe when the Committee will raise interest rates as consistent with some notion of u* being maybe 5 to 6 percent. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That’s correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply making a statement and clarifying a point.


Passage number 74.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Okay.  So that’s the way I took it.  With all that said, I think we can get to a point where we all understand that in this room.  I think the challenges in communicating that to the broader public might be pretty high. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing his personal understanding and opinion, and there is no indication of opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas.


Passage number 75.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll follow in the order that the questions were sent to us. For question 1(a), I do think the maturity extension program is a useful tool.  The estimates of the effect of the maturity extension provided by staff seem quite reasonable.  In talking with financial market participants, they have suggested that the expectation of policy action of this type is one of the reasons that long-term Treasuries and mortgage rates declined so much recently.  I agree with the comments of several of my predecessors, though, that it’s a one-time action, and so we’re going to need to deploy additional tools if we see a financial crisis or the probability of deflation rising substantially.  I think it’s a sensible one-time thing to do, but it is a one-time thing to do. In terms of question 1(b), on the interest on excess reserves, I think that through my questioning it was probably pretty clear what my view was.  I do worry about the optics—that so much of it’s being held at foreign branches.  I do think it helps signaling that we’re serious about keeping rates low for quite a while.  And I do believe it’ll have a fairly modest effect, but given the signaling and optics, we should think about it.  It’s a one-time thing, and if we’re doing one-time things, this would seem to be the appropriate time to think about it. In terms of question 2(a), I think it is useful to make clear that we are intending to restore the economy over time to 2 percent inflation and an unemployment rate in a range of 5 to 6 percent, consistent with our forecast submissions.  We’ve already stated in the SEP that that is what we’re expecting to do in the longer run.  And I don’t think there will be a big impact from that, but it’s probably useful to do it. To the extent that we could be more transparent about our reaction function, a question in 2(b), I think that would also be useful, not only to the public but also to our own deliberations, where it’s sometimes not as clear as it should be whether our policy positions reflect differences in our forecast, differences in our long-run objective, or differences in our reaction function.  Getting more clarity around this table about which of those three things that we disagree on actually would help edify everybody and maybe help us have a more focused discussion. In terms of 2(c), I’m actually not bothered by paragraphs 2 and 4.  I think they’re reasonable—other than that they’re in alternative A rather than alternative B.  But if I were to make a suggestion, I would combine 2 and 4 and maybe focus on three elements, particularly given that, as several people have noted, we haven’t had time to communicate a long-run inflation target of 2 percent and to have some of the communications.  But we do have the SEP projections, and if we were to do something like this conditional language at this meeting, or a meeting soon thereafter, I think it is reasonable, until we have had time to communicate, to focus on the SEP projections and on highlighting that 2 percent or a little bit below and unemployment of 5 to 6 percent—that has not changed.  Also, how consistent is it with the objectives and our forecast. And finally, to the extent that we can make our reaction function clear, I think that’s useful.  Several people seem to be talking about an inflation target as if it’s an inflation ceiling; my understanding of an inflation target is it’s just that—it’s a target that is the midpoint, it’s not a ceiling.  If it is a midpoint, that means at times we would tolerate inflation that’s a little bit higher, and at times we would tolerate inflation that’s a little bit lower.  Particularly at times when we’re very far away from where we think the unemployment rate should be, it would be reasonable to take more risk on getting the inflation rate a little bit higher.  And we could argue whether the appropriate range was 1½ to 2½ or 1 to 3 percent, but I think it’s actually quite consistent with what already is embedded in how we have described the inflation target. I do think that if we’re moving to be very explicit about inflation being 2 percent, we would need to have a conversation with the Congress.  Over time, I would hope that we’d gravitate away from the SEP projections to being more explicit about what our longer-run goals are.  But that would take more time.  That’s all I have.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not contain any clear arguments or disagreements. The speaker is simply expressing their opinions and thoughts about various tools and policies.


Passage number 76.
 MR. FISHER.  Yes, sir.  And let me also just add, if I may, that I’m delighted with the framework exercise because I think that’s really what we should be discussing, and I look forward to it.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Fisher is expressing his agreement and appreciation for the framework exercise.


Passage number 77.
 MR. WILLIAMS.  Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would just start off with a comment about interest rates and lowering interest rates and the effect on spending.  Nine months from now I’m going to have my 50th birthday, and I’ve been promised a midlife-crisis sports car.  So I assure you that if interest rates are lower, I will spend more on that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply contains a personal anecdote and a statement about how lower interest rates would affect the speaker's spending behavior.


Passage number 78.
  [Laughter] MR. BULLARD.  You have a conflict of interest.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. The short excerpt is limited to stating a fact about the situation: "You have a conflict of interest."


Passage number 79.
 MR. EVANS:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me say at the outset that I generally agree with all of your opening comments on flexible inflation targeting.  I think if we were very clear on exactly what that conveys, that would go a long way toward helping with the current situation. The premise of this discussion today is, what should the Fed do if more monetary accommodation is called for but the fed funds rate is stuck at the zero lower bound.  There are two key channels for transmitting more accommodation, and they’ve been discussed already at great length.  The first is to use our balance sheet and work the portfolio-balance effects.  The LSAPs, the MEP, and the RMEP all work that way.  The second is to provide greater forward guidance on an accommodative monetary policy stance.  We can do this by signaling a larger amount of monetary accommodation over a longer period of time.  Strong accommodation would be to keep short-term policy rates at zero for an admittedly uncomfortably long period of time.  This lowers real interest rates owing to higher inflationary expectations.  I would say that given nominal rigidities in labor markets, higher inflation for a time likely would facilitate better matching and hiring as well. But one of the big problems—and it’s been alluded to by Presidents Bullard, Kocherlakota, and Plosser—is the time-consistency problem of promising to have more inflation than what our perceived inflation objective is.  Central bankers will withdraw accommodation prematurely because they don’t like higher inflation, even modestly above a longer-run target.  And of course, external criticism feeds this response, and it’s very difficult to counterbalance those influences.  Now, logically, these perceptions among the public make our current policy stance more restrictive because there’s more of a probability attached to the possibility that we might raise rates prematurely.  So an additional tool to provide added accommodation would be greater clarity of our forward intentions.  Stating economic triggers for a state-contingent policy response can help us.  Doing this in conjunction with a maturity extension program or asset purchases would strengthen the commitment to persistent accommodation.  I have a different view than President Bullard on this.  I think that that would actually be successful in helping display credibility. The Board staff’s analyses provide compelling evidence that further accommodation can be delivered with reasonable safeguards and acceptable risks, in my opinion.  FRB/US and other Board models are the only reasonable macro models that are available to help us to sort through this at the moment.  These models incorporate both sensible, modern macroeconomic analyses and empirically reasonable matches between the model and the data.  Simplistic real business cycle or New Keynesian structures that can’t explain basic features of quarterly or annual macro data can’t be called upon for guidance here.  Our Fed DSGE project is making good progress, but it’s not far enough along to provide alternative answers in those frameworks, and we need to make decisions sooner than we’re going to be making progress on those DSGE models. President Bullard mentioned a New Keynesian model with search by Ravenna and Walsh.  I confess not to have been familiar with this paper, and it’s got a labor market and so that’s good, but as macroeconomists, we tend not to be troubled by the fact that we don’t have labor markets in these models.  Charlie and other early contributors to real business cycle theory didn’t worry a lot about particular details; that’s part of the art of it.  When I asked the staff to look at this model, they summarized it this way:  The Ravenna and Walsh model is not an empirically credible basis on which to base the actual conduct of monetary policy.  I say this because the article’s policy prescriptions are driven almost entirely by an empirically implausible factor.  In particular, the model says essentially that the high levels of unemployment we currently see are due to workers having magically become much more powerful in their wage negotiations with employers.  They’re able to bid the wage up to a high level; they’re thrown out of work; the unemployment rate is high—that’s a key feature in the model’s supply structure.  It’s not necessary to point out how ridiculous that sounds in the current period.  We understand these factors about supply effects in these models, and I don’t believe these influences are relevant for today’s 9.1 percent unemployment rate.  We talked about it in January, and I don’t think we made a lot of progress here.  The way to artfully interpret FRB/US and other models that may or may not have a complicated labor market is to think through those types of factors and whether or not they sound reasonable today.  To me, they don’t. The analyses from FRB/US and company provide a wide variety of comforting risk assessments associated with a forward guidance that’s based upon unemployment and inflation triggers.  I won’t repeat those presentations.  I found them to provide strong support for these positions.  The caveats are well known and can be taken into account, and Mr. Chairman, I thought that you were exactly on target when you opened up by saying that this is sort of like having in our statement something like, “Well, it’s going to be this way until the Red Sox win the pennant.”  We could go further.  We could do it and say “until the Chicago Cubs win the World Series.”  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Incredible.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 80.
  [Laughter] MR. EVANS.  Well, we have the inflation trigger, which is the safeguard against that.  So if structural unemployment is higher than most of us think and I’m wrong about the labor market assessment earlier, then strong monetary accommodation will lead to medium-term inflation pressures sooner than I expect.  The role of the inflation trigger is to provide a good safeguard against this adverse outcome.  If longer-term inflation expectations become unanchored, we will see evidence of this from financial market data and surveys.  In addition, medium-term inflation will move up more quickly than I expect.  Again, the role of the inflation trigger is to provide a good safeguard against this adverse outcome. After reviewing the analyses, I continue to feel that a reasonable and aggressive set of triggers, if it was a decision today, would be 7 percent for unemployment and 3 percent for medium-term inflation.  With an inflation objective of 2 percent, I think that 3 percent inflation is a reasonable statement of symmetric preferences around our objective.  Having said this, I agree with President Kocherlakota that it’s very important for the leadership of the Committee, if we were to go this route, to clearly communicate what our intentions are about inflation and inflation above our objective, what it means for flexible inflation targeting.  Just using that phrase might not be enough.  And in fact, I think that the concerns that President Bullard has about the worrisome zero inflation equilibrium would also be mitigated by the leadership speaking about intentions toward higher inflation because that would be a move away from that equilibrium. Turning to the specific questions and just to finish up, let me reorder them according to my preferences.  First, I think it would be most effective to continue providing some form of aggressive forward guidance.  The use of “mid-2013” was helpful in the context of wanting to provide more accommodation, which last meeting I did.  Providing economic triggers like the unemployment rate and medium-term inflation is the better way—by adding a more credible commitment.  Level targeting might be best, although I think the benefits of aggressive triggers with inflation safeguards may be close to the benefits of level targeting.  Second, announcing complementary purchases that aim to reduce long-maturity term premiums can provide powerful support to the forward guidance.  I find the MEP approach to add acceptable accommodation at the outset; the reinvestment is a good addition, too, but these may not be enough.  In the event that no meaningful progress is made in moving closer to hitting the triggers, adding further asset purchases would increase the level of accommodation.  And with enough forward guidance, perhaps President Bullard’s pace of purchases program would be appropriate at that later time.  Third, I think that reducing IOER as much as is feasible would help a bit, too.  It would be useful at the margin to provide disincentives for financial institutions that currently prefer cash over lending. On the particular questions related to monetary policy communications, I support providing more-explicit, quantitative information about the Committee’s longer-run objective for inflation and its projection of the level to which the unemployment rate will converge.  And I can think of no reason to preclude discussions of the unemployment rate—or the output gap, if that was preferred—as they are critical objects for making monetary policy, and we need to be transparent.  I approve of the general idea of providing information about the Committee’s reaction function, like the economic and inflation triggers I discussed earlier and in August, and I find the language in alternative A, paragraphs 2 and 4, to be quite appealing.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is giving their opinion and support for various monetary policy measures, but there is no conflicting viewpoint presented.


Passage number 81.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  It’s good to have oil, isn’t it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement is an opinion and does not express any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 82.
  [Laughter] MR. TARULLO.  Yes.  But inflation is 1.4, which is the really remarkable thing. There are obviously disadvantages here as well.  If we really did what the Norges Bank does, or something like it, we’d have to make significant changes in our institutional practices—not only the nature of the SEP, but also consider how the Norges Bank conducts itself.  As I understand it, they meet two weeks before they actually make their interest rate decisions, at which point they do the equivalent of thinking about the Tealbook projections and have a discussion of that.  They must be one cohesive group, because the seven of them seem to come up with something thereafter, on the basis of which, two weeks later, they make the actual interest rate decision.  And that might pose cultural or logistical challenges for us to do something like it.  That’s just one example of what might have to be done.  So obviously, one way or another, some delay would be entailed in doing something really meaningful with the SEP.  And this will convey a less precise reaction function, though again, this would assume that the reaction function is, in reality, quite firm. The Chairman—in a question, I think, to John—asked about the delicate situation we have in that an entire group of 17 does our projections, but we only have, for right now, 5 plus 5 actually voting on interest rate policy.  I guess, Mr. Chairman, I would say that I don’t have a specific proposal here.  But it does seem to me that both are relevant.  If one is looking for credibility, then the views and projections of the nonvoting members of the FOMC are quite relevant to providing credibility to markets at large, because even though Sandy and Jeff may not be voting now, they’re going to be voting next year, or they’re going to be voting the year after that.  So their projections are also relevant.  Thus, I might suggest a variant being two different projections if we couldn’t come up with—as I suspect we couldn’t—the consensus adoption (with modification) of the staff analysis that the Norges Bank seems to do. Oh, one final point.  I’m sorry.  This is what happens with notes.  Going back to the maturity extension point, I think John first mentioned today the idea of using MBS again, and then Bill and Janet spoke to it, and Betsy endorsed it as well.  And I would weigh in there.  I know that the earlier concern was that this looks like credit allocation, although I feel a little boxed in here:  People don’t want to do Treasury purchases because it looks like debt monetization; they don’t want to do MBS purchases because it looks like credit allocation.  If you conclude that you want to do purchases, you’ve got to purchase something.  And it does seem, right now, for the reasons that Betsy and Bill identified, that we really could have more of an effect.  As I’ll mention later today or early tomorrow, since I think housing is right at the center of what is keeping us in this slog right now, anything that can be done to affect housing markets, even indirectly, would have a higher payoff.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is discussing various considerations and possible options, without expressing any disagreement or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 83.
 MR. LACKER.  Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This is simply a greeting or introduction from Mr. Lacker.


Passage number 84.
 MR. LACKER.  If I may respond to the good Governor Tarullo.  The reason I keep mentioning our triple mandate is to note that we have read out the objective of moderate long-term interest rates precisely because the best contribution we can make to moderate long-term interest rates is to keep the inflation rate low.  That’s despite the fact that the opposite is true in the short run—that we can, in the short run, raise interest rates by raising short-term interest rates to reduce inflation.  So exactly the same logical relationship between moderate long-term interest rates and inflation exists with respect to unemployment and inflation—namely, fighting inflation may not reduce unemployment in the short run, but in the long run, we all recognize it would be our best contribution.  The Congress can put anything they want in a mandate.  It’s up to us to construe it.  They can ask us to pursue maximizing the postseason performance of the Boston Red Sox, but we’d have to construe what that meant.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining the reasoning behind mentioning the triple mandate and the relationship between inflation, interest rates, and unemployment. They also mention the ability to interpret mandates given by Congress.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 85.
 MR. TARULLO.  That’s true, Jeff, and I understand what you’re saying, but you made a point in part based on how the world would receive a statement endorsed by all or most members of the Committee that associated a number with unemployment.  I would say you can make the converse argument.  If the Committee were to come out now with an inflation target that made no reference to unemployment, that would be construed in a very meaningful fashion as well; personally, I think it would be construed as the embodiment of what some people in the world advocate anyway, which is an inflation-only mandate.  So you’re quite right to say the first statement is going to attract an enormous amount of attention, but it goes both ways.  Omitting unemployment will have just as powerful a message as including something on unemployment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Tarullo disagrees with Jeff's point and argues that omitting unemployment from a statement on inflation targets would be seen as advocating for an inflation-only mandate, which some people support.


Passage number 86.
 MR. LACKER.  I could just agree that there is that division.  I think the division about this issue reflects different visions for how monetary policy affects inflation and unemployment.  And if you think one is more accurate, you like that language; if putting inflation-only accords better with your vision of how monetary policy affects the two, you prefer that formulation; if you prefer a more symmetric approach, it’s because your vision likely reflects a different view of how monetary policy interacts with the economy.  I’m just reading it the way I see it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining that different individuals may have different views and preferences regarding how monetary policy affects inflation and unemployment.


Passage number 87.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I was going to make a very quick comment.  Governor Tarullo pointed to the idea that we have to be careful about whether we’re thinking about thresholds or triggers or rules when we put these numbers into the statement.  In light of that, I would caution that if we do end up putting numbers in—which, as I’ve indicated, I’m not excited about—I think we want to be careful to choose numbers that we’re not likely to change.  I think there’s a tendency to say we want to stick close to 2 percent not to scare people, and so we put in something like 2¼ or 2½ or whatever.  But you want to think down the path and consider that unemployment has remained very obdurate in the space of a great deal of stimulus.  If we get to a point where our medium-term outlook for inflation is above 2½, closer to 3, and unemployment is still at 8½ or 9, what are we going to want to do.  Admittedly, the way that it is crafted is all in terms of thresholds, so it looks as though we have the flexibility, but the interpretation will matter as well. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It falls to me to summarize.  This was a very useful discussion, and I’m certainly glad we had a two-day meeting because—[laughter]—it’s already past 2:15, and I think we would be in big trouble now.  Just a couple of comments.  I’m not going to try to summarize everything that was said.  We will certainly—“we” being mostly Bill English and his staff—be looking carefully at the transcript and trying to summarize from that. On the balance sheet tools, I think most people preferred the maturity extension program to LSAPs at this juncture—with some notable exceptions, like President Bullard—on the grounds that we should perhaps reserve the big gun for later.  However, people raised questions about the quantitative impact or the efficacy of that kind of tool, and observed that it’s a one-shot tool—it can’t be repeated.  I think those are valid questions.  I’ll take the opportunity to editorialize.  Some of the very small numbers on rate changes that were being cited are roughly consistent with a 25 to 50 basis point cut in the federal funds rate, which in normal times we think is a pretty significant action.  I would also comment, again editorializing, that the channels of transmission are actually multifarious through many different ways in which interest rates affect asset prices and behavior.  In the paper on the stock prices that President Fisher cited, the piece of research I did with Kenneth Kuttner, we found empirically that the biggest effect of interest rates on stock prices was through its effect on risk aversion and risk-taking, and we’ve been seeing big swings in risk-taking in asset markets.  To the extent that we affect risk preferences and risk-taking, that would be one channel.  But to come back to the thrust of the conversation, while not many people argued that these were positively harmful—except to the extent that if they’re ineffective, they would harm our credibility—the question that was raised was, how effective would they be. One positive suggestion was made, which I think I’d like to just reiterate.  A number of people—I think starting with the Vice Chairman—made the suggestion about reinvesting redeemed MBS back into MBS.  If we did that, that would keep the MBS stock in our portfolio constant.  It would not increase it, nor would it increase the size of the portfolio.  But it might have the advantages, at least superficially, of addressing the increase in the spread between MBS and Treasuries and reducing the pressure on longer-term Treasury markets.  I think that’s an intriguing idea, and what I’d like to do is ask Brian and Bill to talk about this and, in the morning, give us your comments, if you would, about any risks or concerns you might have about that.  And then, depending on how things go in the conversation tomorrow, I may ask the Committee if they see that as an improvement over alternatives.  So let me just give you that fair warning. On IOER, we had a pretty mixed view.  On the one hand, people were concerned about the perception that we are subsidizing banks, especially foreign banks, and noted that cutting IOER would have at least a marginal impact on the cost of funds.  On the other hand, a number of concerns were expressed about market functioning, and Seth’s memo provided four or five different areas of possible concern.  I’m wondering, Seth, whether you have reached the limit of human knowledge on this subject or whether looking at this a little further over the intermeeting period, for example, or the next few weeks would be useful.  Tell me if that’s not the case.  Can we get more insight into some of these potential costs and risks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is summarizing the discussion that took place and highlighting some points raised by different participants.


Passage number 88.
 MR. CARPENTER.  Well, we can definitely do more thinking about it.  I guess some of the issues are almost inherently unknowable until we get there.  As in the discussions that the Desk had with money funds and in those that President Rosengren had with money funds, you’ll get potentially different answers from talking to different people.  Is it primarily the cost that you are asking about. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The way a lot of people put it is that there are unknowable impacts on market functioning, including money market mutual funds, bank deposits and interest on deposits, federal funds market, and so on.  I don’t know whether more progress can be made on this question or not, but perhaps you could give it some thought.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It discusses uncertainties and potential differing opinions, but there is no active disagreement between the speaker and any other party.


Passage number 89.
 MR. CARPENTER.  Yes.  Let us think about it and then get back to you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply suggesting to think about it and then come back with a response.


Passage number 90.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Just one idea that people have batted around, which I’m not sure is a good idea, but people have talked about an alternative of going slowly to a lower IOER to see what happens.  Because I’m not sure it’s a good idea, I’m not really supporting it.  That’s something that I don’t think the staff has really looked at in detail.  For example, an alternative is that you move it to 20 and you see what happens.  And if nothing bad happens—[laughter]—you keep going. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Chairman Bernanke is discussing an alternative idea that people have been discussing, but he is not expressing support for it himself. He mentions that the staff has not examined it in detail, indicating that there is no disagreement or contention surrounding the idea in the passage.


Passage number 91.
  It’s like, you drive the truck onto the bridge, and you— VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  You walk onto the ice pond. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I see.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply describing a sequence of events.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 92.
  [Laughter] MR. CARPENTER.  After today’s meeting wraps up, we’ll have some discussion and get back to you tomorrow morning with our thoughts. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Give us some sense of what further progress you think can be made. We had the deepest and most interesting discussion on the communications issues.  Clearly, there’s a lot of interest around the table in increasing our transparency, establishing more information about our objectives, and giving more information about our reaction function.  And in particular, we have the problem, or opportunity if you wish, to clarify the guidance that we gave at the last meeting.  I think this is something that should remain very firmly on the table in the sense of something we should continue to work at closely.  A lot of people suggested making more use of the SEP, the Summary of Economic Projections, and that’s something we should certainly talk about.  For example, the view was expressed that the subtle distinctions between an inflation target and the long-run unemployment rate could not be adequately expressed in a statement and needed other kinds of communication like the SEP, press conferences, speeches, et cetera.  And I think that’s worth discussing.  The possibility was also raised of asking additional questions or getting forecasts of interest rates in the SEP.  I do note that—and I think this was raised by at least a couple of people—the SEP is, in the end, the aggregation of our 17 or 19 opinions.  It doesn’t have the imprimatur of a Committee decision, and that’s a bit of a problem that we’ll have to take into account.  But in terms of providing information to the public, I think it is a useful direction. Governor Tarullo noted that our discussions today didn’t really address the worst-case contingencies, which a number of people have brought up.  And I would say that’s by design because today we were talking about tools in the context of flexible inflation targeting.  I think that in a flexible inflation-targeting framework, we would try to respond to prices primarily through lender-of-last-resort activities and liquidity provision.  In terms of monetary policy stimulation, there may ultimately be some limits to how much stimulus we can provide if we’re going to maintain inflation at the mandate-consistent level.  So that’s an issue to be talked about further.  In those “break glass” situations, I think we would want to at least discuss seriously some of the alternative frameworks that have been discussed and proposed.  Again, as I mentioned, we’ll put that on the table for discussion at the next meeting.  We certainly will talk about the kinds of situations in which we might want to take more dramatic action. Thank you for this very useful conversation.  Coffee is ready.  Why don’t we take 20 minutes for coffee, and we’ll come back for the economic go-round. [Coffee break] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We’re finally to item 3 on the agenda.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. This can be seen when the speaker mentions that "A lot of people suggested making more use of the SEP" and "The possibility was also raised of asking additional questions or getting forecasts of interest rates in the SEP." This suggests that there are differing opinions on the use and effectiveness of the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) as a communication tool.


Passage number 93.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Moving right along. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The “Economic and Financial Situation”—Larry Slifman, Steve Kamin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply mentions two individuals, Larry Slifman and Steve Kamin, in the context of discussing the "Economic and Financial Situation."


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 94.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Larry, your view on the likelihood of recession was independent of events in Europe—at least that’s how I took it.  So let’s say, Steve, that you’re wrong and I’m wrong; Europe does not muddle through, and we get the worst case.  How does that, then, affect the view of the U.S..
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage indicates that there is disagreement or contention between Larry and Steve regarding the impact of events in Europe on the U.S. economy. While Larry believes that the likelihood of a recession in the U.S. is independent of Europe, Steve seems to believe that a worst-case scenario in Europe would have a negative effect on the U.S. economy.


Passage number 95.
 MR. SLIFMAN.  Well, we explored that in one of the alternative simulations in the Tealbook.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The subject being discussed is an exploration in alternative simulations, which does not indicate any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 96.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  It didn’t seem negative enough to me when I read it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating their personal perception and opinion about something they read.


Passage number 97.
  [Laughter] MR. SLIFMAN.  It could be even more negative.  The one thing I would point out is that the factor models that I showed on the lower left have sentiment indicators as one of the many variables in those models.  So to the extent that that sentiment currently is being held down, among other things, by the situation in Europe, then that would be captured by the factor models.  But I think the more general point is that we did try to think about what would happen if things got a lot worse in Europe, and as we showed in the Tealbook, that would have adverse consequences.  It would throw us into a recession.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply discussing the potential negative impact that the situation in Europe could have on sentiment indicators and the economy.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 98.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I think what’s hard to capture is that if something bad happens in Europe, it’s not just a GDP feedback loop—it’s a market feedback loop.  And I think back in 2008, we underestimated how powerful that can be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker's statement indicates that there is a disagreement or contention about the extent of the impact of a bad event in Europe. The phrase "I think back in 2008, we underestimated" suggests that there is a difference of opinion or perspective regarding the power of the market feedback loop.


Passage number 99.
 MR. SLIFMAN.  Steve can talk more to it, but the alternative simulation incorporates some of that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that Mr. Slifman believes Steve can provide more information about the alternative simulation. It does not convey any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 100.
 MR. KAMIN.  Yes.  Our simulation involves, for Europe, a very substantial increase, for example, in corporate credit spreads and a decline in consumer confidence there that reduces output in Europe some 8 percent below baseline, which is obviously very substantial.  For the United States, we have also built in an increase in credit spreads, although smaller amounts, as well as some confidence effects, leading to a decline just in the level of GDP below baseline in the neighborhood of 4 or 5 percent.  Now that, I will say, is probably the biggest negative effect we have ever built into an internationally based simulation in the Tealbook.  But we can go further.  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Other questions.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing information and discussing the negative effects that have been built into a simulation. The laughter mentioned at the end does not indicate disagreement, but rather a response to the speaker's statement.


Passage number 101.
 MR. FISHER.  Real quickly, Steve.  Also on the negative potential side—Turkey, Brazil, and China—our staff work indicates that there’s substantial overheating, certainly in the first two, and at risk in the third.  Banking systems are highly fragile.  Have you factored that into your discouraging scenarios.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 102.
 MR. KAMIN.  Well, we have certainly spent a lot of time thinking about that issue, particularly for China and Brazil, which are larger trading partners with us and figure more prominently in my thinking, though we do follow Turkey as well. In China, for some time, there have been a number of property-market-related risks, both in terms of prices having risen very high and in terms of there being very substantial lending, which puts at risk not only some borrowers, but also lenders.  In particular, a lot of state and local governments in China have been using off-balance sheet vehicles to try to channel funds to developers and others.  It’s sometimes like a substitute for fiscal policy for them.  So that represents a concern.  However, it is true that over the past half-year or so, property prices in China, based on our perhaps imperfect measurements, seem to have tailed off a bit and maybe even declined.  And of course, the Chinese government and the PBOC are taking a lot of steps to try to rein in the lending.  It’s certainly something that’s very much on our radar screens, and we’re very aware it.  But we don’t see the overheating problem getting worse, at least as far as the property market in China is concerned. We’ve also been following Brazil carefully for very much the same reason.  There have been very many anecdotal reports of a bubbling property market in the country.  Unfortunately, we don’t have as good data on housing prices there, but there’s no reason to disbelieve the anecdotes.  And part of the problem is that Brazil ramped up credit growth a great deal during the financial crisis and hasn’t really reversed that now.  So we’re watching that carefully.  Thus far, we haven’t seen evidence of a bust of that sort, and we have seen the GDP growth and the economy slowing.  We’re looking forward to that tailing off again without a meltdown.  But it’s something we’re following.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing their thoughts and observations about property markets in China and Brazil without contradicting themselves or mentioning any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 103.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The person being addressed, President Plosser, is being thanked by Mr. Fisher.


Passage number 104.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Yes.  Just to follow up on this, I think the situation in Europe is quite concerning, given the pace at which they seem to be resolving their problems.  And we can talk about a meltdown or implosion of Europe, but it seems to me that one of the things that might happen is an acceleration in the massive flight to quality that we have been seeing, with the consequences being, rather than a flight out of quality of the U.S. banks, a huge inflow of cash.  How would we react to that, or what would the consequences of that be, short of rapid depreciation of the euro relative to the dollar and a huge inflow of cash from European institutions into the United States.  How would that play out, and what would the consequences be for us, if any.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is primarily a statement of concern about the situation in Europe and a question about the potential consequences for the United States.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 105.
 MR. KAMIN.  Well, I will say a couple of words, and then maybe my domestic colleagues can add on.  In some respects, the flight to safety could be a double-edged sword in the sense that on the one hand, most negatively for the United States, it would probably appreciate the dollar very substantially, and we’ve already seen a little bit of that happening.  And that would be adverse for our net exports and represent a contractionary force through that channel.  As well, the flight to quality would probably raise credit spreads for riskier borrowers in the States, and that would be adverse.  On the other hand, of course, Treasury yields would fall more, but it’s not clear how much more they would have to fall, so that plus would be mitigated.  And then finally, there’s an issue that we’re already running into with the movement of money market funds into banks, which is that the banks themselves are hitting their capital concerns.  So I’ll stop there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement or contention in the passage. The speaker mentions both positive and negative effects of the flight to safety. They highlight the potential negative impact on the United States, such as a substantial appreciation of the dollar and adverse effects on net exports and credit spreads for riskier borrowers. However, they also mention potential positive effects, such as falling Treasury yields. Overall, the passage presents conflicting perspectives on the consequences of the flight to safety.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 106.
 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Right.  In the scenario of a very severe European recession that we had in the Tealbook, all those effects that Steve just laid out were there.  You were seeing Treasury yields fall appreciably, and that helped buffer things.  However, the dollar was appreciating; that made things worse.  And we assumed that risk spreads on private securities were going up, which also made things worse.  Going back to Vice Chairman Dudley’s question, the other recession scenario we had in the Tealbook featured some of the special things that might also occur in the event that Europe crashed.  The other recession scenario assumed that the economy is extremely vulnerable at the moment to any sort of kick from anywhere.  It could come from abroad; it could be domestic:  But with any sort of kick, things could play out much worse than the models might usually suggest, because of the strains that households are under, because of the strains that the banking system is under, because people would be looking at monetary policy and saying, “Well, what’s the FOMC going to do to buffer this.  Or, looking at fiscal policy—what’s the federal government going to do to buffer this.”  This isn’t to say that all of those things will happen, but it is our view that if you did have a big kick to the economy—say, from Europe—there’s a very strong risk that the negative effects, even aside from the channels that Steve outlined, would really ramp up because the economy is more vulnerable. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions.  [No response]  Okay.  Seeing no questions, we’re ready for our economic go-round, and I will start with President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage contains disagreement or contention. The speaker mentions that in a severe European recession, certain factors (such as falling Treasury yields) would help buffer the economy, while other factors (such as the appreciation of the dollar and increasing risk spreads on private securities) would make things worse. Additionally, the speaker mentions that there are different views on how the economy would react to a "big kick" from Europe, with some believing that the negative effects would ramp up due to the vulnerability of the economy.


Passage number 107.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I am heartened by how many members are following the Red Sox.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing his appreciation for the number of members who are following a sports team, which shows a positive sentiment.


Passage number 108.
  [Laughter] MR. TARULLO.  If not by the Red Sox themselves.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not contain any clear contentions or disagreements. The mention of the Red Sox does not imply any disagreement.


Passage number 109.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  It’s been some time since I immediately followed in the go-round my friend and colleague from Boston.  I’m tempted to lead off by quoting Monty Python:  “And now for something completely different.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply humorously referencing Monty Python.


Passage number 110.
”  [Laughter] MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  But you won’t.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 111.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  After reviewing the messages from my directors and business contacts, I think the best way to characterize their commentary is that the U.S. economy is treading water at the moment.  No one I speak with disagrees with the view that the economy is largely moving sideways relative to trend growth.  As of now, none see their own businesses dropping off as if the economy were in recession.  Manpower Employment Services noted that its July and August business was volatile—down and then up a bit.  Most of Manpower’s clients are experiencing flat or, at most, small increases in revenue, and some are making contingency plans to cut back on their workforces in case the economy deteriorates.  Other contacts noted similar contingency planning.  One of my region’s best-performing large manufacturers with a globally diversified business line described the current situation by saying, “The ice keeps getting thinner.  We expect things will be fine unless the ice breaks.”  It sounds like nice theater, but here’s the scary part:  The company has instructed all of its units to mock up plans for a 30 percent reduction in capital expenditure spending if it finds it needs to pull the trigger.  To recount the recent fundamentals succinctly, developments in Europe and Washington, weak U.S. economic data, and the associated volatility and net declines in U.S. equity markets all have had negative effects on household and business confidence.  Cyclically sensitive industries, like autos, are expressing substantial concern over the drop in consumer sentiment and the potential for a falloff in demand in the fourth quarter. In financial markets, several contacts noted how things today feel eerily as they did in 2008 before Lehman went down, and one can hardly blame them, considering the risk to financial institutions in Europe, highlighted most recently by the funding stresses faced by the French banks over the past couple of weeks.  One contact noted the widely held expectation that the U.S. economy is in for a long slog but no double dip.  However, they are concerned that this forecast couldn’t hold up to the financial contagion that would result from further significant stresses on some big European banks.  Of course, substantial progress has been made.  Since 2009, U.S. banks are better capitalized and have greater liquidity cushions, and the risks from excessive leverage have fallen in some sectors.  For example, our financial contacts tell us that hedge funds have been reducing leverage for some time.  Consequently, the recent equity market declines did not experience any amplification effect from forced sales to meet their debt obligations.  Instead, recent equity sales likely reflected greater pessimism in general about the economic situation—greater economic risk, for sure, but less leverage risk.  That’s what our contacts suggest. Finally, a different parallel to 2008 is the concern over inflation pressures.  Like today’s situation, back in 2008, there were substantial concerns over the risks of continued higher inflation.  Indeed, my directors and I, in August 2008, voted for an increase in the discount rate in order to reduce those inflationary pressures.  In my opinion, that turned out not to be the right move.  Inflation concerns evaporated quickly with the economic downturn and commensurate with the decline in actual inflation.  Today, with the currently weak business outlook, the pass-through of earlier high materials costs into prices is waning.  At this point, let me take the opportunity—President Lacker made the comment about how output gaps and resource slack in our models depend importantly not just on how you would detrend these objects but also on a comparison with the efficient flex-price equilibrium.  No.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 112.
 MR. LACKER.  No, you don’t detrend them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "No, you don't detrend them" is a simple response to a question and does not indicate any disagreement or conflict.


Passage number 113.
 MR. EVANS.  No, no.  Exactly.  That’s what I’m saying.  They do not rely on detrending.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Evans agreeing with a previous point.


Passage number 114.
 MR. LACKER.  Not “just.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 115.
” MR. EVANS.  They instead rely on comparisons with the flex-price equilibrium.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage is stating a fact or observation about the reliance on comparisons with the flex-price equilibrium, rather than expressing any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 116.
 MR. LACKER.  Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply agrees by saying "Right."


Passage number 117.
 MR. EVANS.  Okay.  Right.  Our DSGE model obeys that type of definition—the Woodford definition.  But here’s the important thing.  It sounds as though we don’t quite know what we’re doing when we talk about resource slack.  That’s not right.  It fundamentally comes down to, what do you think are the sources of the shocks that hit the economy.  In the flex-price equilibrium, it’s going to depend on whether or not you think they are technology shocks, so that in the efficient equilibrium, output is a lot lower in a potential output—or flex-price equilibrium—sense or whether you think that demand is lower, and it’s not the case that potential output is lower.  So if you think that the most recent downturn and impediments to growth are due to technology shocks or higher wage bargaining on the part of workers that leads to higher wages and then to a higher unemployment rate, that would in fact lead to thinking that there’s not as much resource slack and there would be more inflationary pressures.  But if you take the view that they are demand shocks, as our Chicago DSGE model does in fact find, then there’s a lot of resource slack—indeed, there’s a ton of resource slack as they continue to update that model—and inflationary pressures are lowered.  Again, it’s a difference of opinion on what the driving forces are for the current period. To sum up, here’s my simple view on our current macro forecasting exercises.  The economy is performing pretty poorly right now.  There’s no meaningful difference between today’s world and one that has the NBER’s “bad housekeeping seal” of being labeled as in recession.  One typical response during periods of economic weakness, like we face today, is to spend a lot of time trying to figure out whether or not the economy is falling into a recession.  That effort just isn’t necessary at this point.  Whether growth is going negative or slightly positive is not the issue.  Even a continuation of modest positive growth will leave us with large resource gaps, appropriately defined, for an unacceptable period of time.  I continue to agree with the Tealbook’s assessment that substantial slack will result in inflation over the medium term coming in under my interpretation of our objective—namely, 2 percent.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining different perspectives and viewpoints on the sources of shocks and the level of resource slack in the economy. They then express their own view on the current macro forecasting exercises.


Passage number 118.
 MR. BULLARD.  Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply mentions the name of a person, Mr. Bullard, without any context or indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 119.
 MR. BULLARD.  Can I just ask one question of Vice Chairman Dudley.  I thought the whisper on the EFSF was that, yes, they’re going to expand it to €1 trillion, but they don’t want to do that because it will take the pressure off the Spanish and Italian governments.  Is that a reasonable assumption, or do you think that that’s broken down some.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is not indicating any contention or disagreement. It is simply presenting a question and asking for clarification or opinion.


Passage number 120.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I’ll give my answer, and then Steve can give his answer.  My take on it is that getting it through the parliaments is so problematic that they don’t want to add any noise to the process by talking about their need to upsize it or leverage it.  I think they want to get it through the parliaments first with its expanded powers.  And then once they have the expanded powers—it’s like TARP in the United States.  Once TARP got through, it got used for totally different things than what it was originally proposed for.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is offering their own perspective on the topic and suggesting that Steve will also provide their own answer. The explanation provided is solely the speaker's opinion and observation.


Passage number 121.
  [Laughter] MR. TARULLO.  Note the distinction though, Jim, in what Bill just said.  There’s a difference between what Bill just said and saying, “Okay.  We’re going to come back and ask for another TARP now.”  And I think that is a distinction in the minds of the Europeans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is merely pointing out a distinction in statements made by Bill.


Passage number 122.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  My view is that after the parliament has passed the legislation, there may be fuller discussion about how to leverage the EFSF to maybe backstop Spanish and Italian debt, but there’s a reluctance to put that on the table today because that could make it much more difficult to actually get it passed through all of these parliaments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement present in this passage. The speaker is expressing their view on a potential course of action and stating that there may be reluctance to discuss it at that particular moment, but there is no opposition or argument being presented.


Passage number 123.
 MR. FISHER.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage only states that Mr. Fisher replied "yes" to something, without indicating any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 124.
 MR. ENGLISH.  I am going to roll that into my briefing.  I will be starting off with a couple of paragraphs on that.  But maybe Seth can say a few words on the IOER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The speaker, Mr. English, is making a statement about including information in his briefing, and then suggesting that Seth can also provide some input on a different topic (IOER).


Passage number 125.
 MR. CARPENTER.  You asked if we had scope to do any more work on the costs and benefits.  I feel that on the benefits side, we have as much knowledge as we are going to get.  The economic effects are likely small; we know the sign, but the magnitude is very small.  So then I think that it is the political economy subsidy issue that policymakers obviously will have to weigh, how important that is to you. On the cost side, though, it is possible that we could do a bit more work, by talking to banks and money funds, to try to make more precise the mechanisms where we think disruptions would be, how big they might be, and what the probabilities are.  We could talk to banks; we also could talk to the Treasury to understand its constraints about the bill-auction mechanism, per se.  I suspect we could do a little bit more to try to clarify the costs and get back to you with a memo.  Does that seem like a reasonable plan. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You know, you face the difficulty of talking to outsiders without tipping a likely move.  You need to think about whether it’s possible to disguise that discussion in the context of a broader set of issues about market function, for example.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 126.
 MR. CARPENTER.  One possibility is to use the fact that since the spring, market rates have fallen pretty significantly, and talk about that as a pattern and ask what sort of effects they have seen, and then ask them to extrapolate on that if that trend were to continue. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That sounds like a useful idea.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention any disagreement or contention. It simply suggests a possible approach to discuss market rates and their effects.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 127.
 MR. LACKER.  I would just suggest to the staff that it might be useful to supplement that with a more microeconomically focused investigation into who holds what, and what relevant margins of substitution, for which investors, link the IOER, the market funds rate, GC collateral RP rates, and short-term Treasury rates.  Obviously, there are players that can’t participate in all markets.  Pair-wise, you can figure out where some participate and define what those margins of substitution are.  I think this would help us understand how changing IOER would pass through to six-month bill rates, for example, and other relevant borrowing rates.  In addition, I think it would be broadly informative to monetary policy operations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes.

Explanation: The passage suggests that there should be a more focused investigation into the relationship between various interest rates and the holdings of different investors. This implies a potential disagreement or contention over the current understanding of how changing interest rates affect borrowing rates. The suggestion for further investigation implies that there may be differing viewpoints or uncertainties about the specific mechanisms at play.


Passage number 128.
 MR. CARPENTER.  Yes.  That seems exactly right.  And to the extent that we are worried about disruptions, we could also think about the opposite side of the market, who the ultimate borrowers are and to what degree they would be able to substitute.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply acknowledges agreement with a statement and suggests considering another perspective.


Passage number 129.
 MR. LACKER.  Right, exactly.  Same thing on the other side.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is agreeing with the previous statement.


Passage number 130.
 MR. CARPENTER.  Absolutely.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Thank you.  Bill.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 131.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I wanted to make a comment about the use of the date as opposed to my suggestion yesterday of using an announcement of expected duration of our stay at the zero lower bound.  Right now, if the Committee were to stay with the mid-2013 date, in some sense the default is reducing accommodation from that, because you are moving closer to the time when that date is going to take place.  So the default stance is that you are reducing accommodation.  That is very different from when you choose to leave the fed funds rate the same.  In that case, you are not reducing accommodation, you are keeping accommodation the same.  If, instead, the Committee had said in August that they expected that conditions would warrant keeping the fed funds rate exceptionally low for two years, you could leave that statement in place, roll forward six weeks, and you would have the same level of accommodation in place. Now, I have talked offline to some of you about this, and I agree with the general sentiment that we don’t want to be making too many changes at one time.  I’ll take that as read.  But I do think that, going forward, we are going to spend a long time at the zero lower bound.  It is worthwhile to make this change—away from a date to a duration—to get away from the automatic tightening that is built into this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining their suggestion for using an announcement of expected duration of stay at the zero lower bound instead of a specific date. They also acknowledge that they have talked to some people offline and agree with the sentiment of not making too many changes at once.


Passage number 132.
 MR. ENGLISH.  To respond to that for a second, if everything played out exactly as the Committee expected, then that duration would have to be reduced by six weeks at every meeting.  Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, Mr. English is simply stating a fact about the duration of a certain event, without expressing any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 133.
   MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  That’s correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 134.
 MR. ENGLISH.  It’s a tradeoff.  In which case are you going to be changing things.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It seems to be a statement or opinion expressed by Mr. English about a tradeoff and changing things.


Passage number 135.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  But that’s how raising the rate usually works, Bill, right.  If you look at a usual kind of monetary policy rule, you will set the rate according to current conditions.  But if you are below trend and there is mean reversion, you are expecting conditions to improve, and as they do, you raise the rate accordingly.  Even if you are on your forecast path under the usual fed funds rate in normal conditions, we would be raising the rate along that path, even if things just played out according to what we expected.  So that’s right.  I’m trying to design a system at the zero lower bound that will work the way our fed funds rate movement will usually work.  I will talk more about this in my policy statement, where I think our not using this over the past 10 months has actually had a cost. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think the one thing everybody agrees on is that the mid-2013 language needs further elaboration.  And we will continue to work on that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing their views on monetary policy and the need for further elaboration on a specific issue.


Passage number 136.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Right, sure. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That is certainly a useful suggestion.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "That is certainly a useful suggestion" indicates agreement with the previous statement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 137.
   MR. FISHER.  I wanted to ask simply a point of information.  Is it true to say inflation has moderated since earlier in the year.  On a year-over-year basis.  Now, we expect it to moderate, and the rest of the sentence is correct.  But is that correct.  I want to check.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage shows contention or disagreement. The speaker is questioning whether it is true to say that inflation has moderated since earlier in the year on a year-over-year basis, indicating a possible disagreement with the information provided.


Passage number 138.
 MR. ENGLISH.  I guess what I was looking at in writing that down was things like CPI inflation.  The six-month change was up around 5 percent in the spring, and it’s around 3.6 percent in the latest numbers.  Three-month changes were up around 6 percent in the spring, and now are around 2.6.  So those measures have come down.  The PCE numbers look about the same.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating different inflation figures and noting that the measures have come down.


Passage number 139.
 MR. FISHER.  I was looking at the 12-month for core and the trimmed mean, et cetera. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The 12-month numbers have not come down mechanically because some of the deflation-like numbers are being left out.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It is a statement about the speaker's observation regarding the 12-month numbers.


Passage number 140.
 MR. FISHER.  I would just be careful about that.  That’s our expectation, but I don’t think that statement is correct because it depends on what time interval you measure, 12 months, 6 months.  I would moderate it somehow were I to support alternative B. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Fisher is expressing caution and suggesting a moderation in supporting alternative B, but he does not directly oppose or disagree with President Lacker's statement.


Passage number 141.
 MR. LACKER.  I was going to support that.  It has the look of cherry-picking the statistic you’re looking at.  We don’t want to get caught shifting which one we are focusing on or appealing to from meeting to meeting. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, except that in the August statement, which is the first page of the handout, we said, “More recently, inflation has moderated as prices of energy and some commodities have declined from their earlier peaks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. Lacker expresses his agreement with the statement being discussed.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 142.
” MR. LACKER.  We set the precedent there to focus on less than 12 months of inflation, right.  “Are we going to stick to that.” is the question we need to ask ourselves. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It’s a fair question.  We could say inflation appears to be moderating, which might be better given the commodity price behavior.  Let’s put that down as something for consideration if anyone wants to advocate that.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, suggests that there is a precedent to focus on less than 12 months of inflation, but questions whether they should continue with that approach. He suggests an alternative perspective of inflation appearing to be moderating, which others may advocate for. This suggests a disagreement or debate about how to approach the issue of inflation.


Passage number 143.
 MR. EVANS.  I could be wrong, but this seems to be a relatively new development in our statement, right.  Because we used to use the term “underlying inflation,” and underlying inflation had a connotation of a little more ambiguity for good or bad, right.  I mean, we have all cherry-picked at times, “I’ve been saying 12 months.  Now I’m going to roll into the 3-month window because that’s what I think is more indicative of our pressures.”  And when we took out the underlying measure concept, we bought into this other problem, which is that we really ought to be talking about inflation over the medium term, with the emphasis on forecasting.  We ought to think more carefully about how to deal with this.  I agree with that. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Except that one suggestion that the Vice Chairman and others have championed is that the first paragraph ought to be sort of a retrospective of what we see has happened and that our forecast should be in a different part of the statement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage contains a statement about a disagreement, but the passage itself does not contain any actual disagreement or contention. It is simply discussing different perspectives on how to approach inflation forecasting in a statement.


Passage number 144.
 MR. EVANS.  But “underlying inflation” is helpful for that, and it’s also more related. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I don’t want to go through that whole discussion again, but a very similar concept is “medium-term projections of inflation,” which would be equivalent to “underlying.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Evans, where he expresses his opinion about the concept of "underlying inflation" and its relation to "medium-term projections of inflation".


Passage number 145.
” MR. EVANS.  Yes. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I’m sorry.  President Pianalto, did I skip you.  Did you have a question. MS. PIANALTO.  I have a question, but not on this issue. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Go ahead. MS. PIANALTO.  Bill, in your comments about reinvesting our MBS into Treasuries versus reinvestment into MBS, you made a comment that it reduces the effect of the program.  I know we only put this possibility on the table yesterday, so you didn’t have time to think about it further or talk to anybody, but what kind of market reaction will we get.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The participants are simply clarifying who should speak and discussing a different question.


Passage number 146.
 MR. ENGLISH.  I’ll look to Brian Sack in a second, and he may have a different sense, but mine is that markets don’t know exactly how big the maturity extension program is going to be.  They don’t know exactly how we would be handling reinvestments and so on.  My guess is they probably expect we would be reinvesting agency securities into longer-term Treasuries as well, but nonetheless, taken together, the package will look broadly similar to what markets are expecting.  I don’t think there will be a big disappointment.  They will, I think, be surprised if the Committee decides to reinvest into MBS.  That’s something that I haven’t been reading a lot about, and as I said in my remarks, we do think that would probably have some effect in the MBS–Treasury spread.  Brian, do you have thoughts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It is primarily the speaker sharing their own thoughts and speculations about market expectations.


Passage number 147.
 MR. SACK.  I agree.  The major surprise will clearly be on the MBS side.  So I think you would see a sharp reaction of the MBS spreads to the announcement.  In terms of how Treasury yields would respond, as Bill suggested in his briefing, the effect would be modestly less than if the reinvestments went into longer-term Treasuries, but my guess is that, relative to market expectations, the maturity extension part of it will essentially meet expectations and won’t prompt much of a backup in rates.  I think that the program is a little bit bigger than most people assume, at $400 billion, and as I will talk about later, if you went with this proposal, we’d actually have a maturity distribution that’s pretty skewed to the long end.  Those two things suggest that the maturity extension piece will meet expectations on the Treasury side in terms of preventing a backup in rates. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is primarily expressing their agreement with the previous statements and explaining their own thoughts and predictions.


Passage number 148.
 MR. FISHER.  Could either of you continue on.  What are the negatives of reinvesting the roll-offs in MBS, in your opinion.  Bill.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 149.
 MR. ENGLISH.  As I said in my remarks, I think there are two.  One is the Committee might be seen as allocating credit, and you’ve been nervous about that in the past.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 150.
 MR. FISHER.  We went through that before.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating that they have previously discussed the topic mentioned.


Passage number 151.
 MR. ENGLISH.  And the other is that when it comes time to exit, your portfolio of agency securities will be larger, and therefore the sales of them will take longer or will have to be more rapid.  There will be some adjustment to be made at the end to unwind this and get back to a Treasury-only portfolio, which the Committee has been absolutely clear it wants to get to.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply explains that there will be an adjustment needed to be made at the end to unwind the portfolio and get back to a Treasury-only portfolio, which the Committee has expressed its clear intention to achieve.


Passage number 152.
 MR. FISHER.  So we have a pretty clear concept of what the costs are.  We also have a pretty clear concept of what the benefits would be.  If that spread is widened, we do believe, as you just summarized, that it will impact mortgage-backed rates and help decrease that spread over 10-year Treasuries.  Is that a correct summary.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is summarizing the concept of costs and benefits and confirming if their summary is correct.


Passage number 153.
 MR. SACK.  That’s correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement present in the given passage. The response is straightforward and does not involve any conflicting opinions or views.


Passage number 154.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no statement or argument in the passage that can be contentious or lead to disagreement. It is a simple expression of gratitude.


Passage number 155.
 MR. SACK.  A few more things to note.  Past FOMC communications have left this door open, as Bill indicated in his briefing.  At the same time, in terms of the longer-run strategy, the Committee has emphasized the move to a Treasury-only portfolio.  So I think there will be some discussion of that and perhaps some confusion.  The other thing is that there are broader housing initiatives in play at the moment, and don’t be surprised if you took this step to see a discussion of this step in terms of how it interacts with those other initiatives.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply listing a few additional points to consider and expects that there may be some discussion or confusion around them.


Passage number 156.
 MR. FISHER.  If I may, Mr. Chairman, would it be considered, in your opinion, counterproductive to those other initiatives.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not express any contention or disagreement. It is simply a question asked by Mr. Fisher.


Passage number 157.
 MR. SACK.  No.  In terms of effects, I think it would be very productive.  I’m just making a few points about how this will be discussed and what the market commentary will be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement expressed in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their own opinion and making some points about the discussion and market commentary.


Passage number 158.
 MR. FISHER.  Yes, sir. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that Mr. Fisher responds affirmatively to President Lockhart.


Passage number 159.
 MR. LOCKHART.  To follow up on the mortgage-backed securities questions, if by reinvesting we’re putting pressure on those rates, we’re also putting pressure on Treasury rates that are often references for mortgages.  Is it possible that our prepayment assumptions need to be adjusted so that the actual duration of the mortgage-backed securities portfolio will somewhat soften and, therefore we have a two-step duration concern.  One is that we are changing our mix, and the second is we have to rethink what the prepayment assumption is.  Is that possible, Brian.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
There is no clear disagreement or contention in this passage. The speaker is simply asking a question and seeking clarification or confirmation.


Passage number 160.
 MR. SACK.  Yes.  We have prepayment projections where we expect about $200 billion of principal payments on agency debt and agency MBS by the end of June of next year.  That would be the amount under our current projections that we would be switching into mortgage purchases.  If those purchases pushed down rates by more than we had assumed in the Tealbook, that number could be higher and result in even more reinvestment in MBS.  I don’t think the size of the rate effects we’re talking about will affect that too much.  Another thing to note is that, at $200 billion, we’re actually already pretty high relative to prepayment models produced by Wall Street.  So there’s a lot of uncertainty around that $200 billion number, and my guess is, under the current rate structure, the risks are toward being smaller than that than being bigger. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing information and discussing uncertainties.


Passage number 161.
 MR. LACKER.  I have a couple of questions about the mortgage-backed securities thing.  First, for the record, I think I know the answer to this question.  In your staff presentation yesterday, I didn’t recall any mention of dysfunction or dislocation in the mortgage-backed securities market.  I take it you don’t have any to report on, or if there are, I’d appreciate hearing that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for clarification about the absence of information in the staff presentation.


Passage number 162.
 MR. SACK.  No.  We don’t think there is dysfunction in the mortgage-backed securities market at this time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.  The speaker states a straightforward opinion without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 163.
 MR. LACKER.  So the staff’s view is that, compared with not doing the MBS reinvestment, this would likely lower the MBS spread by some measure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is presented as the staff's view, indicating a consensus or agreement within the staff.


Passage number 164.
 MR. ENGLISH.  Likely.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information that suggests disagreement or contention. It simply states someone's likelihood or tendency.


Passage number 165.
 MR. LACKER.  So doesn’t this mean that Treasury rates would be higher than they otherwise would be because we’re taking less Treasury out of the market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement of hypothesis or deduction.


Passage number 166.
 MR. ENGLISH.  That’s what I tried to say in my remarks, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. English is affirming that he tried to convey his message accurately.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 167.
 MR. LACKER.  If we’re able to reduce the MBS spread, there’d be some other borrowers in the economy that would face higher cost than otherwise, right. Does the staff have a sense of the differential effect on spending.  Is lowering mortgage rates going to result in enough spending to counteract the reduced spending on the part of the people for whom borrowing costs are going to go up because of this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes

Explanation: There is disagreement or contention in the passage because Mr. Lacker is questioning whether lowering mortgage rates will result in enough spending to offset the reduced spending by other borrowers who will face higher borrowing costs. This implies a potential disagreement or uncertainty about the overall impact of lowering mortgage rates on spending.


Passage number 168.
 MR. ENGLISH.  As I said in my remarks, the reason to do this would be the sense that the housing market is in particularly poor shape, and so providing assistance there is likely to be, at the margin, more useful, but I don’t have any numerical exercises I can point to on that.  We had about 18 hours to think about this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that Mr. English doesn't have any numerical exercises to support his point about the housing market. There is no contention or disagreement presented.


Passage number 169.
  [Laughter] MR. SACK.  And we do think the upward pressure on Treasury yields relative to the other proposal will be limited.  I was trying to explain in the answer to President Pianalto’s question that even at $400 billion without the reinvestment piece added on, the maturity extension program is still sizable relative to market expectations and is probably skewed more toward longer-term securities than most market participants expect.  I think those factors will help limit any upward pressure we see on Treasury yields.  It is hard to judge exactly what is priced in.  We should appreciate that there is some uncertainty about these market responses, particularly about how far out on the curve we’re expected to go on the maturity extension program.  In general, it’s a fair assumption that the backup in Treasury yields will be quite modest.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is explaining their thoughts and reasoning regarding the upward pressure on Treasury yields and the market response to the maturity extension program, but there is no disagreement or contention expressed.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 170.
 MR. ENGLISH.  I agree there isn’t dysfunction in the MBS market, but the MBS–Treasury spread is pretty wide.  It’s gone up about 50 basis points in recent months.  We think that’s because with rates very low, the expected duration is probably longer than usual, so investors are a little chary of buying the MBS, and there’s a lot of uncertainty about the duration.  That spread has widened out, and this would be a way of taking a step to try to unwind some of that widening. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Is some of it due to net supply–demand balance.  Is there a change in the flows, Brian.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker acknowledges that there isn't dysfunction in the MBS market, but then mentions that the MBS-Treasury spread has widened and offers an explanation for it. This suggests a disagreement or difference in opinion about the cause of the spread widening.


Passage number 171.
 MR. SACK.  Some of it is due to at least concerns about supply related to the discussion about government refinance programs.  The point is that those programs could cause a large amount of refinancing of the higher coupon into the production coupon, and I think that is putting some upward pressure on the production coupon spread.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that there are concerns about supply related to government refinance programs, which could potentially cause a large amount of refinancing, putting upward pressure on the production coupon spread.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 172.
 MR. LACKER.  Bill, on the sources of uncertainty, do you think you know better than the market about those things.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. This is evident in the phrase "do you think you know better than the market" which suggests a difference in opinion or belief between those involved in the conversation.


Passage number 173.
 MR. ENGLISH.  No.  It’s simply risk that we could take out of the market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not express any contention or disagreement. It states that there is simply a risk that could be removed from the market.


Passage number 174.
 MR. LACKER.  It’s real risk.  I mean, it’s risk to us, too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating a fact about the situation without expressing any disagreement or argument.


Passage number 175.
 MR. ENGLISH.  So it’s duration risk.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact or concept.


Passage number 176.
 MR. LACKER.  Okay. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  A two-hander from the Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any indication of contention or disagreement. It simply states that there is a two-hander from the Vice Chairman.


Passage number 177.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  What I hear the staff saying is that the effect on Treasury yields is quite small because, one, you’re not moving that much money away from the Treasury market and, two, the program is still going to be as big or bigger than expectations.  In addition, it will also have a pretty sizable effect on the mortgage basis because it is unanticipated.  It’s going to change the whole risk–reward perception of private investors in the mortgage market because they are going to realize that if the mortgage basis winds out dramatically, the Fed is now more likely to intervene, and that’s going to change the dynamics in the mortgage market.  Now, why would you do it in terms of who gets the benefit.  Well, I think the marginal propensity to consumer of people who are refinancing is probably pretty high relative to other participants in the economy who might be affected by that couple of basis point backup in Treasury bills.  And, too, there’s an ancillary, broader benefit to the extent that you can make housing markets slightly less distressed.  While the benefits are obviously hard to quantify, if the housing sector is in a little bit better shape, that has a whole other set of benefits.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It mainly presents an explanation of the staff's perspective on the potential effects of a program on Treasury yields and the mortgage market. There are no conflicting viewpoints or arguments presented.


Passage number 178.
 MR. LACKER.  If I could respond, the stress in the housing market isn’t among people who are going to be capable of refinancing at a slightly lower rate.  These are people that have good credit now.  The distress is somewhere else.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Lacker is simply providing additional information and clarifying the situation in the housing market.


Passage number 179.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Assume you have a demand curve for mortgage rates, the demand will be slightly stronger for housing than it was before if mortgage rates are a little bit lower, and I think that has consequences for households. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Can we save the substance for the go-round.  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating a fact and expressing their belief that lower mortgage rates will have consequences for households. The laughter at the end seems to indicate that the statement is lighthearted or humorous, rather than contentious.


Passage number 180.
 MR. PLOSSER.  I have an empirical question.  Pick your number of what you think this would do to mortgage rates or the mortgage spread—10, 15, 20 basis points.  The question I want to ask is:  Based on what’s happened over the last three years, what’s the empirical evidence about how that will change housing starts, sales of existing homes, or house prices.  What’s the empirical evidence we have as to the effect that that will have on the housing market measured by the things that we are interested in.  Do we have any estimate for that.  Maybe that’s a question for Dave.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a question posed by Mr. Plosser regarding the potential impact of a certain factor on the housing market, and he is seeking empirical evidence or estimates to support his inquiry.


Passage number 181.
 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  There are two answers to that.  One, if you take our models estimated over longer periods, housing is a pretty interest-sensitive sector.  Second, over longer periods, if you look at the response of house prices to interest rates, there’s not much evidence of a response.  Now, looking at the past few years, it is very difficult to tease out the interest elasticity.  It could be that the interest elasticity is extremely low at the moment, partly because of the difficulties of people qualifying for mortgages with tighter standards and the smaller pool of people who have decent credit scores.  However, the other way of looking at it is that there’s a powerful interest-rate effect in play at the moment, but it’s being swamped by concerns about continuing falling house prices and that sort of thing.  The housing market has certainly been behaving very peculiarly in the last few years.  Everyone agrees on that.  None of the models can explain what’s going on.  Is it decreased interest sensitivity.  Could be.  Is it a very powerful dynamic on expected house price changes and things like that.  Could be.  Is it tighter underwriting standards and credit conditions that are independent of the interest sensitivity.  Could be.  I think some combination of those is at work, and I can’t untangle them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker presents different potential explanations for the behavior of the housing market without taking a strong stance on any one of them. They acknowledge that there is uncertainty and difficulty in determining the exact factors at play.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 182.
 MR. PLOSSER.  So it’s likely that the players who are going to be able to take advantage of this maybe won’t be the homeowners and the homebuyers.  It’s going to be the traders who are going to be trying to arbitrage whatever they think we’re going to do between Treasuries and MBS and other things, and whether or not that’s going to have the effect that we want on the real economy is questionable.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Plosser, suggests that the traders taking advantage of the situation may not have the desired effect on the real economy, implying a disagreement with the effectiveness of their actions.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 183.
 MR. ENGLISH.  That seems too strong to me.  I think it will contribute to lower mortgage rates and more refinancing, and that will matter.  Who’s doing the refinancing and exactly which households are benefiting is subject to question. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Any other questions.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage shows disagreement or contention as Mr. English disagrees with the statement about lower mortgage rates and more refinancing potentially benefiting households.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 184.
 MR. LACKER.  I just point out that if the Treasury yield difference is little or none, then we have this miraculous ability to reduce spreads everywhere, sector by sector, with no cost to anybody in the economy, and that can’t be the case. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It could be the case.  Why can’t it be the case.  Suppose we could buy corporate bonds in large amounts.  We would be effectively, through money creation, financing credit extension.  We’d be a new source of credit extension.  I’m not saying that’s a good way to allocate resources, but it would certainly affect spreads.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The initial statement by Mr. Lacker suggests that reducing spreads without any cost to the economy is unlikely. However, the response suggests that it is indeed possible to reduce spreads without incurring any costs, presenting a different viewpoint.


Passage number 185.
 MR. LACKER.  If you look at budget constraints and resource constraints, there’s a certain amount of savings going on, and it’s getting channeled to a certain amount of resources that are going to a certain amount of borrowers.  From that point of view, if we increase the resources going to some borrowers, it has got to come from somebody. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That’s only with a total output being given.  This is the basic error of the crowding out arguments that you’ve been hearing, which is that holding output constant, if you increase deficits, you’re going to reduce investment.  That’s not true if output is, in turn, endogenous and responds to fiscal conditions.  If output responds to monetary policy stimulus, that’s going to affect income and saving. I feel like we pretty much covered the issue here.  [Laughter]  Any further questions.  [No response]  If not, why don’t we just go now into the go-round.  And we’ll start at the far west of the country with President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is merely explaining their point of view on the topic of budget constraints and resource allocation.


Passage number 186.
 MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  As I mentioned yesterday, maturity extension is an effective policy tool that can help lower longer-term interest rates.  I was going to comment on lowering the interest rate on reserves, but I understand we will get more memos on that between now and the next meeting.  We will look forward to that memo and that discussion next time.  I supported pursuing this particular policy of maturity extension at the last meeting, and I think the case for taking this step is, if anything, even stronger today, given the deterioration in the economy and even greater downside risks.  I also support reinvesting principal payments from agency securities in agency MBS for the reasons discussed yesterday, also summarized by Bill English.  Specifically, I see this as lowering spreads on MBS, and I also think, importantly, it creates space for further Treasury purchases.  As Vice Chairman Dudley said, there could be a very powerful signaling effect of this as well.  This is the right step at this time. Let me say a word about the appropriate stance of monetary policy, and how that has changed since last November.  Governor Yellen made these very same points yesterday, so I will try to be very brief.  Basically, we looked at where the forecast was in the November Tealbook from last year and compared that with the forecast as of the current Tealbook.  Regarding monetary policy, I think it makes sense to be forward-looking and consider the forecasts, as opposed to where we are currently. The November 2010 Tealbook forecast for the unemployment rate at the end of 2012 was 7.9 percent.  Today it is 8.7 percent.  And the Tealbook forecast for core PCE inflation next year has climbed from 1 percent to 1.5 percent, an increase of ½ percentage point.  Obviously, there are factors telling you to have less monetary accommodation, and some saying that you should have more monetary accommodation, relative to our forecast from last November.  But when I plug these forecast changes into a Taylor 1999 policy rule with coefficients of 1½ on inflation and minus 2 on the unemployment gap, it implies a reduction in the funds rate of 85 basis points.  Based on this simple metric—which only incorporates the information about the change of our modal forecast—the change in the outlook argues for significantly more policy easing than we thought appropriate back in November based on the outlook that we had at that time.  I think alternative B takes us a step in that direction. Finally, I would like to comment on the need for more contingency planning.  I completely agree with President Fisher’s remarks yesterday, and also the remarks of others who followed on yours.  I am very concerned that economic conditions could take a serious turn for the worse, especially if the situation in Europe spins out of control.  We need to think carefully now about what we will do if the worst-case scenario materializes.  In that event, we would likely be employing unconventional policies and operating at the zero lower bound for many, many years, much as Japan has.  In contemplating such a situation, I am sympathetic to President Bullard’s point that we need to get away from one-shot, fixed-duration policies that we have used in the past, and move instead to a more systematic framework.  In particular, we should plan now about how we would conduct and communicate asset purchase programs that are more open-ended and adaptable to changed circumstances.  As I mentioned yesterday, I think we will clearly need to broaden the set of securities that we purchase to include mortgage-backed securities.  Furthermore, I am increasingly worried that we could find ourselves in a situation where the yield curve is essentially flat at very low rates, and the economic situation is still not satisfactory.  I think the traditional LSAP and communication policies may not be sufficient to achieve our macroeconomic goals.  If you look at Japan and Switzerland, they both currently have 10-year government rates of around 1 percent.  If we find ourselves in a situation like that—even after we have used all of our LSAP and communication policies—we really do need to think seriously about outside-the-box approaches to monetary policy, including the use of emergency-type programs or other approaches.  We need to be doing that planning now rather than later.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 187.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In my comments, I will generally support alternative B and talk about alternative B.  Let me start with paragraph 1, the last sentence.  I, too, thought that the phrase, “Inflation has moderated since earlier in the year as prices of energy and some commodities have declined from their peaks,” was a little bit strong.  I think it has been an improvement to eliminate the confusing references to underlying inflation, and I would take it that our basic measure of inflation, when we say “inflation,” is PCE inflation measured from a year ago.  I’m looking at page 23 of the data sheets here, which has all our data on consumer prices.  This is what is presented to the Committee.  There are six charts here, with a lot of upward sloping charts in 2011, so I think it might be a little bit strong to say this.  I have a suggestion that I think more accurately will reflect your view, Mr. Chairman, which is that instead of using “Inflation has moderated since earlier in the year,” we could say “Inflation is expected to moderate as prices of energy and some commodities have declined.” The new first part of the very last sentence in paragraph 1 would be “Inflation is expected to moderate.”  It would mean that, indeed, we think headline inflation is going to come down.  Yes, it is kind of high right now if you look at these charts, but we think it is going to come down.  That very much reflects the staff view and the view that you expressed earlier in your comments. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Could I just explore that for just a second.  The only objection is that we also say in the next paragraph, “The Committee anticipates inflation will settle in coming quarters,” which is a little bit repetitive.  What about something like the earlier suggestion, “Inflation appears to be moderating;” is that better.  It’s more descriptive, rather than pure forecast.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Bullard disagrees with the statement "inflation has moderated since earlier in the year" and suggests a different wording to reflect the view that inflation is expected to moderate. He also questions the repetition in the next paragraph and suggests a different wording for that as well.


Passage number 188.
 MR. BULLARD.  There are an awful lot of upward moving lines here.  It is true that these three-month averages show little blips down, but that might be a little bit of a thin reed to hang your hat on. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So, it “appears”—what is your view.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Bullard is simply providing his observation and expressing some skepticism about the significance of the small downward blips in the data.


Passage number 189.
 MR. BULLARD.  “Appears to have moderated.” CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  “Inflation appears to be moderating.”  Does that help.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is expressed in a positive manner, suggesting that inflation is slowing down or becoming less severe.


Passage number 190.
 MR. BULLARD.  What is wrong with just “expected to moderate”.  I think that’s fine.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Bullard is expressing his agreement and stating that he believes "expected to moderate" is a suitable phrase.


Passage number 191.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  My critique of that is, I think it is very important that the first paragraph be a statement of what we see, not a view about our forecast or our expectations.  It should be a description of our view of reality.  When you say “is expected to,” then you are getting into something more forward-looking, and I am not in favor of that. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Let’s see.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage expresses an opinion and preference, but there is no explicit disagreement or contention. The speaker is stating their critique and preference for the first paragraph to focus on a description of reality rather than expectations or forecasts.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 192.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  One suggestion I would have is that the Committee actually specify exactly what inflation rates they had in mind when they say that inflation rates are moderating.  I think it is certainly true of the three-month frequency.  Maybe it is also true of the six-month frequency.  If the Committee has a particular frequency in mind, then you can make reference to that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes

Explanation: The speaker is suggesting that the Committee should specify the exact inflation rates they are referring to when they say that inflation rates are moderating. This suggests a disagreement or contention regarding the lack of specific information provided by the Committee.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 193.
 MR. BULLARD.  I don’t mind the story that it is expected to moderate.  I just don’t want people to look at this picture and say, “Well, what is the Committee thinking.”  PCE inflation measured from a year ago is up close to 3 percent, and core inflation has also gone up quite a bit and is still on an upward slope.  Just say “is expected to moderate.” CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That’s your proposal, and others can respond as we go around.  Please continue.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Bullard expresses concern about people interpreting the situation differently and disagrees with the proposed statement that inflation is expected to moderate.


Passage number 194.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Real growth has obviously been much weaker than we had hoped for, or that we view as desirable.  But as I said yesterday, I think the inflation outlook is central to our policy decision today.  A year ago inflation was running around 1 percent, and it looked as if it had the potential to continue falling.  That made it very attractive to provide more stimulus to aid the real economy, and if that also increased inflation, it was for the good.  I understand the rationale for intervention a year ago.  But now inflation is 2.9 percent year over year, and 2.1 percent over the last three months.  Core inflation is 2¼ percent over the last three months and the three months before that, and survey measures of inflation are ticking up.  I understand what is going on with TIPS yields, but it is a mixed picture on inflation expectations. As I said yesterday, the balance of evidence suggests to me that our asset purchases initiated last November contributed to the rise in inflation, but had little or no effect on real growth.  So my sense is that the alternatives—A or B—to the extent that they have material economic effects, are going to push up inflation and do very little for economic growth.  And with inflation running above what everyone articulates as their preferred rate, I do not think we now want or need more monetary stimulus.  Accordingly, I support alternative C. I understand how raising inflation would reduce real rates and provide stimulus for the real economy.  But I do not believe we could publicly acknowledge allowing inflation to rise and still keep inflation expectations from rising even further from time to time after that.  I do not believe we would have an easy time reversing course and bringing inflation expectations down again without significant real costs.  Even if I was wrong about that, and we could easily raise and lower inflation, we would have set a precedent that would permanently limit the credibility of our commitment to price stability, because always in the back of a market participant’s mind would be the notion that in 2011 we raised inflation deliberately, and we could do it again.  That will affect our conduct and our ability to meet our objectives for years to come.  A strategy of tolerating a bit more inflation in an attempt to reduce unemployment bears, to me, more than a passing resemblance to the strategy pursued in the late 1960s and 1970s, and that was, obviously, such a dismal failure.  I found it disturbing to have heard this notion entertained.  I think it is agreed in hindsight that policymakers then placed excessive emphasis on unemployment, excessive blame on commodity price increases as opposed to their own policy errors, and excessive faith in the sluggishness of inflation expectations.  Now, some of you no doubt view there as being a substantive distinction between the strategies we pursued then and the notion of tolerating higher inflation, higher than it is now today.  I would love to understand it, because I don’t get the distinction at this point. I fully appreciate that unemployment has been painfully high for an excruciatingly long time period, and that high unemployment is associated with substantial losses in well-being for many Americans, relative to an alternative world in which we came into today’s meeting with a much lower unemployment rate.  I understand the compelling urge to do something, even if there are legitimate doubts about how much of an effect monetary stimulus can have at the zero bound, which is the circumstance we find ourselves in.  But if monetary stimulus is effective at the zero bound, what are those effects.  Are they real, or are they on inflation.  I don’t think there is any question that we should be more confident that monetary stimulus is going to affect inflation than it is going to affect real growth.  That comes from a reading of monetary economics going way back.  It is the effect on real growth and the non-neutralities of monetary policy that are the really hard things in macroeconomics and that have divided us and divided the profession from time to time.  I think inflation is one thing that we know monetary policy can affect if it affects anything. As I said, I support alternative C.  On the off-chance that the Committee gravitates to alternative B—[laughter]—I have a couple of observations to make.  First, about the inflation language, I agree with Vice Chairman Dudley that we should keep forward-looking statements out of paragraph 1, and that the movements we made to doing that are sound.  If we have something to say about what we expect inflation to do, let’s keep that grouped in paragraph 2 with everything else about the future.  “Appears to be moderating” is a welcome addition to that.  Under questioning, we can direct people to the three-month rate.  At this point, I don’t think we want to enshrine the three-month rate in the statement.  I’m a little hesitant to do that without thinking that through a little more. Halting our transition to a Treasury-only portfolio is a terrible idea.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 195.
  My head has stopped spinning right now, but— [Laughter] MR. PLOSSER.  It’s on fire.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The laughter that follows "It's on fire" suggests that it is meant to be a humorous or exaggerated statement, rather than a serious disagreement or contention.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 196.
  [Laughter] MR. LACKER.  This takes us into the realm of fine-tuning sectoral spreads, and it begs questions.  What about small business lending.  What about municipals.  There are plenty of sectors where there is distress, urgency, and a need.  People are going to ask, “Well, you’re helping out the housing market, why aren’t you helping out our sector.”  That’s the reason we have stayed away from this stuff until the crisis, and we should keep on that track by getting out of the business of subsidizing housing.  This perpetuates this really corrosive political economy in our country of tapping government resources to subsidize the housing market.  I should think we would be a little averse to that, given the damage that caused in the last crisis. About President Bullard’s point on announcing $400 billion versus $45 billion, I think that is a cogent point.  I will make the observation here about quantitative easing.  We apparently are viewing, according to our Vice Chairman, quantitative easing as off the table because of the political backlash we got last year.  That’s my sense.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, expresses disagreement with the idea of subsidizing the housing market and suggests that it perpetuates a damaging political economy. He also disagrees with the decision to avoid quantitative easing due to political backlash.


Passage number 197.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I would say that’s too strong.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The statement represents a subjective opinion or evaluation, rather than an argument or conflicting view. It does not present a conflicting perspective or raise any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 198.
 MR. LACKER.  Too strong.  Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that something is "too strong," without indicating any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 199.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Not off the table.  The bar is high.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage states that "Not off the table" and "The bar is high" without any context or subject to indicate any disagreement or contention. Therefore, there is no evident disagreement in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 200.
 MR. LACKER.  The bar is high.  Right.  I have sour feelings about setting a higher bar.  We have had two instances of naked political intimidation in the last week, and I think we all gravitate toward the notion that we set policy the way we see it.  I’d like to believe that we do that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. 

Explanation: Mr. Lacker expresses his "sour feelings" about setting a higher bar, likely implying that he disagrees with the idea of raising the standards or expectations. Additionally, he mentions instances of "naked political intimidation," which suggests disagreement with the current political climate. This implies contention or disagreement within the passage.


Passage number 201.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I was very clear yesterday that we have to set policy based on what we think is right.  But if the politics wreck the efficacy of the policy tools, then we have to take that into consideration as an environmental factor.  There is an important distinction between the two.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no apparent contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating that policy should be based on what they believe is right, but acknowledges that political factors can impact the effectiveness of those policies. They also highlight the importance of differentiating between these two aspects.


Passage number 202.
 MR. LACKER.  I wasn’t sure I quite understood the extent to which the political backlash would affect the efficacy of the policy without affecting our subsequent actions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Lacker expressing his uncertainty about the impact of political backlash on the efficacy of a policy.


Passage number 203.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  If the policy caused people to think that LSAPs would lead to a big inflation problem or loss of confidence in the Fed’s credibility, the policy would be less effective, and so we might decide that the cost-benefit analysis is no longer favorable.  You’re not not pursuing the policy because of the political pressure, you’re not pursuing the policy because the political pressure is going to undermine how well the policy instrument works in practice.  That’s an important distinction, I think.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any explicit contention or disagreement. It discusses the potential consequences and considerations for pursuing a particular policy, however, without any conflicting viewpoints presented.


Passage number 204.
 MR. LACKER.  Would that work through beliefs about our future actions or not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The question is asking about a hypothetical situation and does not involve conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 205.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I think it can work through a whole variety of ways.  It could affect inflation expectations; it could affect our future credibility.  I think there are a lot of channels.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any clear contention or disagreement. It simply discusses different possibilities or channels through which something can work.


Passage number 206.
 MR. LACKER.  Those both seem like our future actions. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  There was some evidence that the reaction affected market expectations of the continuation policy, and that reduced the stimulus impact.  Both internally and externally, assuming we do the maturity extension, I think we ought to note it has its own legitimate benefits.  In particular, it does not create massive additional excess reserves, which could create problems for our banking system.  Second—and I think the evidence already suggests this in terms of what we are seeing in markets—because it doesn’t increase high-powered money, it may have less effect on inflation expectations, which would be a positive from your perspective.  I think it has some legitimate benefits, even aside from these calculations.  Let me just assure everybody that we will do what we need to do, and political interference will not determine our policy actions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of the speaker's opinion and assurance.


Passage number 207.
 MR. LACKER.  I’m glad to hear that.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  If I might just say one word about the analytics between the 1970s and today.  There is, of course, one very important distinction, which is that we are at the zero lower bound in the liquidity trap.  You are familiar with the Krugman 1998 paper, which says in that particular case there may in fact be a permanent tradeoff—or at least a very long-lasting tradeoff—because only by increasing inflation expectations can you lower real rates at the zero bound.  I’m sure you know that literature.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 208.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  It is a privilege to follow my esteemed colleague from Richmond.  Here we provide the full range of options with just two commenters.  [Laughter] The economic outlook in the Tealbook clearly calls for action, and I would argue that the Tealbook outlook is on the optimistic side.  As I look at the pricing of Greek debt and credit default swaps, I wonder whether the baseline forecast should include a Greek default.  However, even with a more benign assessment of Europe, my forecast for both inflation and unemployment are consistent with significant action.  My preference for this meeting would be to do three things.  First, I would explicitly condition the forward guidance on economic outcomes, as President Evans has discussed recently, using language similar to what is in alternative A.  Second, I would reinvest principal payments of MBS back into MBS.  I strongly support that.  Third, I would do the Twist, but signal that should financial instability increase, or the economy deteriorate further, more-aggressive policy would be considered.  In particular, if conditions were to worsen, we should be considering targeting intermediate Treasury rates consistent with our conditional language and expanding our balance sheet.  While my preference is a combination of A and B, I can support alternative B with paragraph 3.  I do hope that the forward guidance based on the SEP is considered for our next meeting.  I actually agree with President Kocherlakota that it might be worthwhile considering whether using two years, rather than a calendar date, would be a more appropriate way of describing time. I normally don’t comment on language, but this time I feel I should.  In paragraph 1, I think the criteria should be that it’s factual and consistent.  If we use three-month inflation rates, we are, in effect, going to be describing commodity prices and oil prices.  That doesn’t seem to be what we are trying to convey.  For retrospective, I actually agree with President Evans that we should be using core or underlying inflation, so we don’t overweight temporary supply shocks.  Prospectively, we should be using total, because in the medium-term total and core are likely to be quite similar.  Going forward, we could come up with an agreement that if we are going to characterize it, then we characterize it consistently in that fashion.  In terms of paragraph 3 and 3′, this is a one-time program, as we discussed yesterday.  Talking about it in total makes much more sense than talking about it parsed in nine ways.  In particular, when I look at the language at the bottom of paragraph 3, “The Committee will regularly review the pace of its securities transactions and the overall size of the maturity extension program,” I would not use that language.  I would go back to the August language that says, “The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate.”  I don’t think that parsing an extension program into very small bits will be particularly effective.  That language implies that we might consider doing that, and I don’t think we should.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply stating the speaker's preferences and opinions on various topics. There is no clear contention or disagreement.


Passage number 209.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I usually begin my policy round statement declaring support for one of the alternatives, and that is usually alternative B, which is appropriate for a member of the quiet middle.  Today, I am going to take a different approach.  Because I am a nonvoter at this meeting, I am going to give myself permission to put some arguments on the table for the sake of devil’s advocacy.  As I stressed in the economy round, I would argue that the ambiguity of the moment should give pause, pointing to a preference for alternative C at this meeting.  One might prefer alternative C not out of strong conviction that no action is called for, but out of preference for not acting quite yet.  The case for holding off is included in the broader Tealbook case for alternative C, which Bill English just recited.  I would add to that case, as devil’s advocate, that an approach that might have the most positive impact in jolting the economy out of its apparent torpor is a binary one.  By that I mean either do nothing or go all in, but avoid incremental half-measures. Let me present three reasons for holding our fire at this meeting.  First, the hard data and anecdotal reports suggest that the second half of the year will be better than the first half, even if not by a lot.  The staff Tealbook forecast assumes that an alternative B is required to generate this outcome.  I would argue that skepticism on this point is warranted.  Even conceding that the very modest rate effects assumed by the staff will be realized from an alternative B policy, marginally lower longer-term rates won’t stimulate much additional borrowing and business activity producing job growth.  Lower longer-term rates might stimulate some refinance activity by homeowners and commercial real estate owners, but short of some top-down program of comprehensive mortgage refinancing, the effect is likely to be marginal on real-side activity.  Second, while acknowledging the sentiment that the Tealbook benchmark implies an uncomfortably slow decline of the unemployment rate, one could be just as uncomfortable with the persistent upward drift in core inflation measures.  As the Tealbook shows in charts labeled “Evolution of the Staff Forecast” on page 31, misses giving rise to upward revisions in unemployment forecasts have been matched by misses in upward revisions of core inflation forecasts.  A benchmark forecast that has a fairly large drop in inflation premised on an unemployment rate projected to remain high, in my opinion, should be questioned.  A third argument for holding fire is to let a little time pass to gain perspective on the circumstances the Committee is facing.  Per this argument, sentiment is being weighed down by an unfortunate confluence of bad or troubling news that arrived in a very short span of time.  By that I mean benchmark revisions, the debt ceiling spectacle, the S&P ratings downgrade, Europe, the jobs report, Hurricane Irene, and inflation numbers. I would argue that, considering both the data and the reports from contacts, the economy is not presently on a slippery slope to recession.  This view argues for giving ourselves a little more distance from the events of late July and early August before concluding that the economic landscape has changed so fundamentally that the economy cannot achieve escape velocity without further action on our part. Turning to the action side of what they called a binary approach, I would argue this:  If there is no progress toward firmer economic growth, and there is actual deterioration and/or it becomes clear that the European issues or the fiscal mess in this country are likely to suppress economic activity going forward, stronger action than alternative B is needed, conditioned, of course, on no deterioration of the inflation outlook.  It may be the case that a sequence of incremental policy steps ultimately accumulates to a big step.  But if a jolt to the patient is what is needed, one big step may be preferable.  So going all in—the expression I used earlier—could resemble President Bullard’s proposal: an open-ended, quantitative easing commitment to be held in place until the Committee is satisfied that a sustainable recovery is firmly established or until we have to change course to meet our price stability mandate.  Again, I am presenting these arguments in a devil’s advocate vein, not in outright opposition to alternative B. Switching to angel’s advocacy, if that is a term, regarding alternative B, just a couple of comments.  First, I favor 3′ as being somewhat more flexible.  Second, I am sympathetic to the mortgage-backed securities reinvestment proposal.  I think it might make a difference.  If I could wave a magic wand once to help demand, it would be to lower all mortgage payments in the country.  Third, in response to President Bullard’s suggestion, I agree that there is something slightly wrong with the description of inflation in paragraph 1.  A simple fix would be to add the word “somewhat,” “inflation has moderated somewhat,” to try to capture a little bit of the ambiguity and slight disappointment we feel in the way inflation has evolved during the year.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting different perspectives as both a devil's advocate and an angel's advocate, but there is no disagreement or argument between the two positions presented.


Passage number 210.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I think it is going to average slightly above 2 percent over the next two years. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think there has been a miscommunication that I do need to address—just a couple of preliminary points.  There is a pretty broad agreement that we are flexible inflation targeters, and President Bullard and others have made that acknowledgement.  That is the only one that is consistent with the dual mandate so that means that we are looking at medium-term inflation and allowing for some flexibility in the short run. Just a comment on the Taylor rule, which is on current variables, so a worsening in the outlook associated with financial distress would not appear in any way in that kind of model. But let me address the thing that you have said a number of times, and I really don’t understand.  It’s true that I have said in a number of speeches that our target is 2 percent or a bit less, by which I mean that if you look at the SEP, it reports that the central tendency of our Committee is 1.7 to 2.0 percent.  What I’m saying, basically, is that the target is 1.85, let’s say.  What I have never said—and I don’t think anybody around this table has ever said—is that we will not tolerate inflation above 2 percent.  That is a very different proposition.  Under a flexible inflation-targeting regime, with quadratic preferences or whatever weights you want to put in it, depending on the state of unemployment, there would be times when you would tolerate inflation a bit above the target.  In particular, there is no inconsistency with having inflation a bit above 2 percent and having a π* that is 1.85 percent.  I understand that you have concerns, and you have every right to disagree.  But on that one point, I really don’t think that that is correct.  The ECB has a somewhat different kind of approach where they seem to have a ceiling.  But we have never expressed a ceiling approach to inflation.  Rather, we have a target around which there is going to be some random variation and policy variation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage explains the speaker's view on inflation targeting and clarifies some miscommunications, but there is no clear contention or disagreement stated.


Passage number 211.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Mr. Chairman, I think that this underscores the challenges of communicating with the public on this point.  I think that the public perception of our framework is closer to the idea that we will not tolerate 2 percent.  It would be very helpful to clarify—exactly as you have now with me—what our inflation target means and what it does not mean.  In my view, the reactions to President Evans’ recent remarks show that there is a sense in the general public and in the media that our medium-term targets really translate into something we have to meet on a year-by-year basis. Those of us that are involved in the idea of monitoring cost recovery for the product office might be familiar with this example:  In the product office, they are supposed to recover costs over a 10-year horizon.  The way we implement that is by watching them closely on an annual basis to make sure they are doing cost recovery.  With that, I think it will be very helpful—certainly for my own thinking about policy—for the general public to hear exactly this clear explanation you just gave to me about what the framework is.  Thank you.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 212.
 MR. LACKER.  Would “appears to have moderated” be more consistent with Dudley’s dictum regarding the first paragraph. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That’s fine with me.  Is that okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. MR. LACKER suggests a slight revision, "appears to have moderated" instead of "moderate," and states that it is fine with him.


Passage number 213.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  That’s fine with me.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "That's fine with me" indicates agreement or acceptance, and mentioning President Plosser does not introduce any conflicting views.


Passage number 214.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Just an observation.  In some respects, the moderation of fuel and energy prices is what’s really driving the moderation of overall inflation at this point. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  And that’s what it says in the sentence here, too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply presents an observation about the moderation of fuel and energy prices and its effect on overall inflation, without any explicit disagreement or contention.


Passage number 215.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Fuel and energy prices have moderated, period. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Right, but we count those.  “Appears to have moderated,” is that fine.  All right.  Any objection.  Okay.  “Inflation appears to have moderated.” I’m going to come back to 3 versus 3′ because I would like to hear the Committee’s view on that decision.  First, on paragraph 4, does anyone have a reaction to the Vice Chairman’s suggestion of reordering those two sentences.  Any particular concerns. MS. YELLEN.  Good idea. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  If we did that, it would be, “to help support conditions in mortgage markets, the Committee will now reinvest . . . in agency mortgage-backed securities.  In addition, the Committee will maintain its existing policy rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.”  Have you got that. I have a compromise suggestion on paragraph 6.  On the one hand, as Governor Raskin very appropriately pointed out, we did discuss the range of policy tools.  The statement should correlate to some extent with the events of the meeting.  On the other hand, I think that “the full range of its tools” is a little aggressive.  I would propose that, as a number of people have suggested, we go back to the language of August, which is identical to this without the brackets.  “Discussed the range of policy tools” is a reasonable step.  I don’t think it promises any additional action in the near term.  Is that okay. MS. DUKE.  “These” rather than “its.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement evident in the passage. The speakers appear to be discussing and suggesting different ideas, but there is no indication of a disagreement or argument.


Passage number 216.
” MR. ENGLISH.  Yes, change “these” to “its” to make it work with the brackets.  You could go back to “these” if you want to use exactly the language in there. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Let’s make “these” into “its.”  In other words, let’s just take paragraph 6 as it stands without the brackets, which is essentially the August language. Now the somewhat substantive decision is 3 versus 3′, and we will come back to a couple of issues there in a minute.  Paragraph 3 gives the full amount, but it does note that there will be review of the program in light of incoming information.  Paragraph 3′, which is more along the lines that President Bullard has advocated, gives a monthly rate.  Perhaps it’s a bit more contingent.  We will have the same last sentence in either case, which will be some kind of regular review.  I’d be inclined to take a straw poll on this decision unless there’s anyone who wants to make a comment.  Anyone.  [No response]  How many are in favor of 3, which gives the $400 billion total number.  [Show of hands]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.  How many are in favor of 3′.  [Show of hands]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking for a straw poll to determine which option the group prefers.


Passage number 217.
 MR. TARULLO.  Some of these people are voting against alternative B. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  What.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage is simply stating a fact - some people are voting against alternative B. There is no indication of contention or disagreement in this statement.


Passage number 218.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  It should be a vote for B.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage simply states that "It should be a vote for B," without presenting any opposing viewpoints or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 219.
 MR. TARULLO.  Yes, and Richard didn’t vote. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No, that’s fine.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, that's fine.


Passage number 220.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I voted, but I thought it was a straw poll. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That’s all right.  Your wisdom is still welcome even if you don’t agree with all of what we’re doing here.  [Laughter]  Did we have seven to six.  I see a mild majority for 3. Finally, but in order to maintain the review aspect, President Rosengren, you wanted to change the last sentence there, “regular review”  back to what was in August.  Is that right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 221.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  That’s correct. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The last sentence of paragraph 3 now says, “The Committee will regularly review the pace of its securities transactions and the overall size of the maturity extension program in light of incoming information.”  What we had in August was, “The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate,” a simpler statement.  Any preferences.  Jim, do you have a preference.  Narayana.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking for preferences or opinions on two different statements.


Passage number 222.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I like Eric’s suggestion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention any disagreement or contention. It simply states that the speaker likes Eric's suggestion.


Passage number 223.
 MR. BULLARD.  I’m happy with it, too. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Are you okay.  I hope this is not too complicated.  Let’s change the last sentence of 3 to the analogous sentence from August.  Are there other comments, suggestions.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses satisfaction and asks if others agree or have any additional comments or suggestions.


Passage number 224.
 MR. LACKER.  This removes the phrase “maturity extension program.” CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes, it does.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. In this statement, Mr. Lacker simply states that the phrase "maturity extension program" has been removed without expressing any opposition or disagreement.


Passage number 225.
 MR. LACKER.  We’re going to have to figure how to communicate our name for this program. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It’s the MEP, clearly.  You know how much attention they paid to LSAP, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. Lacker is simply suggesting that they need to come up with a name for the program and proposes calling it MEP. He mentions LSAP to emphasize the point that attention to program names is important.


Passage number 226.
  [Laughter] MR. ENGLISH.  It’s going to be “Operation Twist” no matter what you say.  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I understand that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not depict any disagreement or contention. The laughter indicates a lighthearted and jovial atmosphere, suggesting that the exchange is meant to be humorous rather than confrontational.


Passage number 227.
 MR. LOCKHART.  But not “quantitative easing.”  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We should have done statement A, which has both the MEP and the communications, so that we could have “Twist and Shout.”  [Laughter]  Never mind.  It wasn’t my idea.  Further comments.   In a moment we’ll take a vote.  Let me say that at the end of the vote, Brian, you’re going to talk just a little bit about implementation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It includes laughter and light-hearted remarks, indicating a casual and agreeable tone in the conversation.


Passage number 228.
 MR. SACK.  Sure. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Following that, after the end of meeting announcements, we’ll have lunch, and Linda, I believe, will give us a congressional update. MS. ROBERTSON.  I’m prepared to do so. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  She is prepared to do so.  Please, are you able to give the statement. MS. DANKER.  We’ll see.  I’m starting with alternative B that was handed out.  The first paragraph is the way it was except the second-to-last sentence starts, “Inflation appears to have moderated since earlier in the year,” and then continues as it was. Paragraph 2, unchanged. Paragraph 3—we’re keeping paragraph 3, dropping paragraph 3′, and the final sentence of paragraph 3 is being removed and replaced with the analogous sentence from the August statement that starts, “The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings,” and so on. Then paragraph 4 will begin with the sentence that starts, “To help support conditions in mortgage markets, the Committee will now reinvest principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities.”  Then, “In addition, the Committee will maintain its existing policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auctions.” Paragraph 5 stands as is, and paragraph 6 stands as is minus the brackets. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay. MS. DANKER.  Keeping what was in the brackets, just to clarify. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes. MS. DANKER. Chairman Bernanke   Yes Vice Chairman Dudley   Yes Governor DukeYes President EvansYes President FisherNo President Kocherlakota   No President PlosserNo Governor RaskinYes Governor TarulloYes Governor YellenYes  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Brian, do you want to take a couple of minutes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a discussion about the agenda and changes to a statement, and all individuals involved seem to be in agreement.


Passage number 229.
 MR. SACK.5  I will offer a brief description of how the Desk plans to implement the Committee’s decisions regarding the SOMA portfolio. Following recent practices, the Desk intends to release a statement with operational details on these initiatives at the same time as the release of the FOMC statement.  A draft of the Desk statement is provided in the handout for your reference. Let me begin with the $400 billion maturity extension program. The Desk plans to distribute the purchases from this program across five sectors based on the approximate weights shown in the table contained in the statement.  This distribution has been designed to extend the average maturity of the SOMA portfolio.  For that reason, it allocates a much larger share of the purchases to longer maturities, including those beyond 10 years, than in previous asset purchase programs.  Of course, this distribution could be altered if market conditions warrant. In terms of selling assets, the Desk plans to conduct regular operations to sell Treasury securities with remaining maturities of three months to three years.  Securities with less than three months to maturity will not be sold to provide the markets and the Treasury with greater certainty about the maturity profile of SOMA holdings.  These operations will be structured to receive bids across a range of securities and to accept them based on their attractiveness to market prices.  We will be selling roughly three quarters of the SOMA holdings in the eligible maturity range. At this point, the Desk anticipates conducting 14 purchase operations and 6 sale operations per month.  A schedule of both purchase and sale operations to be conducted over the following calendar month will be released on or around the last business day of each month.  A schedule of operations expected to take place in October will be released on Friday, September 30. Let me now turn to the agency MBS reinvestment program. Principal payments from holdings of agency debt and agency MBS will be reinvested in agency MBS through purchases conducted in the secondary market.  Based on current projections, the Desk anticipates that reinvestments will total about $200 billion by the end of June, thus resulting in an average monthly pace of purchases of $20 to $25 billion over that period.  However, I should note that the prepayment rate on the MBS portfolio is quite uncertain in the current environment, and hence the actual pace of purchases could deviate meaningfully from our projection.  5 The materials used by Mr. Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 5). The Desk intends to conduct these purchases internally, rather than relying on an external investment manager.  Recall that we had established this capability by the end of the earlier asset purchase program.  We would expect to be active on most trading days, and purchase operations would be conducted through a competitive bidding process over an external trading platform.  We will continue to rely on external firms for middle-office support and custodial services. In terms of other operational details, we anticipate that the purchases will be concentrated in newly issued agency MBS, as these securities have greater liquidity and are more closely tied to primary mortgage rates, although the Desk may purchase other agency MBS if market conditions warrant.  We also would like the flexibility to use dollar roll transactions to facilitate the settlement of our transactions.  The settlement conventions for agency MBS and dollar rolls mean that the SOMA balance may fluctuate around $2.6 trillion. Purchases of MBS securities will begin on October 3, 2011, and the current practice of reinvesting principal payments from agency debt and agency MBS in Treasury securities will be halted at that point.  The Desk will continue to publish on the eighth business day of each month the planned amount of reinvestment purchases for the next month, but we will no longer be including a calendar for the reinvestment operations since we will be purchasing on most trading days in the secondary market.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Any questions for Brian.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 230.
 MR. LACKER.  This is a question more generally about what conversations we’ve had with the U.S. Treasury and what we’ve gleaned from those about their debt management.  Are they going to react.  Do they pledge not to offset us.  What do we know.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage is stating a question and seeking information about the conversations and insights gained from the U.S. Treasury regarding debt management and potential reactions or pledges. There is no contention or disagreement present in this passage.


Passage number 231.
 MR. SACK.  We speak to Treasury regularly about debt management issues, and not surprisingly, we’ve been discussing that in the context of a maturity extension program in recent weeks.  My understanding is that Treasury has no intention of reacting to our program in terms of shifting its issuance any time soon into longer-term securities because we’re conducting the maturity extension program.  You should keep in mind, though, that they are on a course right now that is extending the average maturity of their debt, and they’ve been doing that for some time, consistent with the recommendation of their borrowing committee.  The weighted-average maturity of their debt will continue to extend, but that pace isn’t going to accelerate just because we’re doing the maturity extension program.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It is a statement of the speaker's understanding of the Treasury's intentions regarding debt management and the maturity extension program.


Passage number 232.
 MR. LACKER.  They’re going to continue extending the maturity of what they issue while we’re trying to reduce the maturity of what’s in the hands of the public.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 233.
 MR. SACK.  That’s right, but let me make a few more comments on that.  The additional maturity extension that’s going to be realized is already under way based on debt management decisions they’ve made to date, and my sense is that they’ve maybe reached the point at which they are ready to start to pull back from that objective.  Yes, we will continue to see a lengthening of the weighted-average maturity given past decisions, but I think we’ll see that lengthening begin to slow and at some point stabilize.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply providing more information and giving their own opinion on the matter.


Passage number 234.
 MR. LACKER.  How does the magnitude of what you expect to be subsequent extension of the maturity of what’s in the hands of the public due to their issuance compare with what we’re doing with the maturity extension program.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a question asking for a comparison.


Passage number 235.
 MR. SACK.  I believe the effects of the further extension that we expect would actually be larger than the effects of the maturity extension program that has been proposed today.  A few things to note.  One, that’s already priced into the market.  The weighted-average maturity of Treasury debt today is 62 months.  As far as we can tell, the market expectation is that that’s going to reach 70 months—another 8 months of extension—but we believe that’s fully expected and priced into the market.  Second, it doesn’t seem that Treasury is intent on purposefully pushing beyond what’s in the markets and, if anything, seems to be shifting perhaps in the other direction.  And, third, we can think of these effects as being in place and then think about the FOMC’s programs as trying to affect financial conditions around what would have been realized under Treasury’s path.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their beliefs and observations about the effects of the further extension and the market's expectations.


Passage number 236.
 MR. ENGLISH.  That is what we did in the memo that was distributed to the Committee.  We built in assumptions about what Treasury was up to, and looked at our program at the margin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply describing a process of making assumptions and analyzing their program.


Passage number 237.
 MR. LACKER.  Right.  You’re telling me that there’s a fair amount of uncertainty about what they’re going to do. SEVERAL.  No.  Not really.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker responds by saying "No. Not really" which indicates agreement with Mr. Lacker's statement about uncertainty.


Passage number 238.
 MR. LACKER.  Go to 70 or not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 239.
 MR. SACK.  They’ve been clear that they will not be changing their strategy in response to our program.  There’s no ambiguity about that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker states that "They've been clear that they will not be changing their strategy." This statement indicates a lack of ambiguity in the response from the mentioned party.


Passage number 240.
 MR. LACKER.  But you don’t know what their strategy is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, is stating that he does not know the strategy of the other party.


Passage number 241.
 MR. SACK.  Their strategy is that they realize the weighted-average maturity will continue to lengthen, but that they’re going to start, over time, to make adjustments that should cause that lengthening to slow and eventually to stop.  They have not given a precise number of what their weighted-average maturity target is.  I’m not sure if they have one at this point, and they’re engaged in a very active discussion of these issues with their own borrowing advisory committee.  I’m not sure.  I don’t think it’s precisely settled in their mind exactly where they want to end up, but it is my understanding that they do not want to continue to lengthen indefinitely.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply describes the strategy and the uncertainties surrounding the target of weighted-average maturity.


Passage number 242.
 MR. LACKER.  This contrasts notably with the first Operation Twist in which cooperation was fairly clear with the Treasury.  We understood what they were doing with their portfolio and what we were doing with ours.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is describing a contrast between the current situation and the first Operation Twist, highlighting the lack of clarity and cooperation between Mr. Lacker and the Treasury in the current scenario. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 243.
 MR. FISHER.  But, Mr. Chairman, this is a very delicate issue, and I think you’re going to have to figure out if there’s a way to do it when you put out the Frequently Asked Questions on September 26.  There may have been virtues back in 1961 to doing it hand-in-glove.  There could also be drawbacks to being perceived as doing it hand-in-glove now.  You’re going to have to carefully vet this wherever you vet these things to make sure that we don’t look like we’re setting this up. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We have been very clear:  We don’t want to involve the Treasury in monetary policy decisions or monetary policy execution.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing caution and the need for careful consideration of how certain actions may be perceived.


Passage number 244.
 MR. FISHER.  Yes, but I would address this in the Frequently Asked Questions that we provide. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  There was a Financial Times story, which I believe made the point that should the Federal Reserve undertake any kind of maturity extension program, the Treasury would not react to that.  That’s the appropriate thing we’ve asked them to do, and I’ve received assurances to that effect as well.  Any other questions.  [No response] First, let me note that we’ll have a special topic in January called “The Role of Financial Conditions in Economic Recovery: Lending and Leverage,” which was a very popular winner among the FOMC participants and certainly is a topical issue.  I want to thank the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco for agreeing to lead the preparations for that special topic.  The next meeting is another two-day meeting, fortunately, Tuesday and Wednesday, November 1–2.  Lunch is available, and for those who can stay, Linda Robertson will be providing a presentation.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing information and updates on various topics without any conflicting viewpoints being presented.


Passage number 245.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Mr. Chairman, there was such a call for contingency planning that November seems, at least under certain circumstances, pretty far away.  Is there any thought in your mind as to how we can address that between meetings. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You should help me, Bill.  My understanding is that we expect to get the framework memos out exceptionally early in the intermeeting period.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is asking for help and clarification from someone named Bill, but there is no indication of disagreement or conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 246.
 MR. ENGLISH.  We’re aiming to do so, but we wanted to do so this past intermeeting period, too.  Yes, we will try our hardest to get the material out in early October so that there will be plenty of time for people to think about it. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  If there are Reserve Bank contributions that would like to be made, please be in touch with Bill, and we’ll try to coordinate additional materials.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing a desire to release material in early October and requesting coordination for additional contributions.


Passage number 247.
 MR. LOCKHART.  The process sounds like react to memos and circulate views and essentially do it all that way between now and November. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  What else would you suggest.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This is simply a question asking for suggestions or alternatives.


Passage number 248.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Well, we may be overtaken by events.  You never know.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states that events may happen unpredictably.


Passage number 249.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Are you proposing a videoconference or something like that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking if the other person is suggesting a videoconference as a possible option.


Passage number 250.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Yes.  Something like a videoconference where we can have a spontaneous exchange of views as opposed to the formality of reacting to a memo and circulating that and then reacting to someone else’s reaction, and so forth. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We’re certainly prepared to do that, either assuming we get early preparations or if the situation changes in a significant way.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, Mr. Lockhart is discussing the benefits of having a videoconference for a spontaneous exchange of views instead of the formality of reacting to a memo. He also mentions their preparedness for the situation to change. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 251.
 MR. TARULLO.  Mr. Chairman, to draw a distinction, I think you’ve been referring to more conventional monetary policy contingencies.  I believe that staff at the Board and the New York Fed have already been thinking about liquidity facility contingencies. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Oh, yes. MS. YELLEN.  Is that what you were thinking of, liquidity and the like.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Tarullo is clarifying the type of contingencies being referred to, and Ms. Yellen confirms that she was indeed referring to liquidity and similar issues.


Passage number 252.
 MR. LOCKHART.  I really wasn’t, in my mind, making a distinction.  I’m just noting there’s such a call, and November may be too late in some respects. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, on the purely financial stability side, we have an ongoing LISCC, an Office of Financial Stability, and other coordination occurring on an operational daily basis.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply providing information about ongoing coordination and activities.


Passage number 253.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Would it be inappropriate for the Board to have a meeting or a conference call so that we are filled in on what the Board staff is thinking in terms of the liquidity provisions and other things that might arise during such a time. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Certainly, but again, the LISCC, for example, is a Systemwide committee, which in principle can report.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Plosser is simply suggesting that the Board should have a meeting or conference call to be updated on the thoughts of the Board staff regarding liquidity provisions and other matters.


Passage number 254.
 MR. LACKER.  Not every Reserve Bank is on it. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Not every Reserve Bank.  Your point is taken.  I don’t know if Nellie is here.  We will try to make sure that there is some kind of call at an appropriate time, particularly if there are any important developments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 255.
 MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, without giving offense, which I’m sure I will, I do think it’s important that we all be on board with this, but we also have to be extremely mindful that none of this leaks out to the public, and that’s what worries me. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  What.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The speaker, Mr. Fisher, is expressing concern about the issue of secrecy and confidentiality but does not directly oppose or contradict any other person or viewpoint present in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 256.
 MR. FISHER.  If any of this contingency planning leaks to the public. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. This is indicated by the use of the word "if" in the statement made by Mr. Fisher. It suggests that there is a potential for disagreement or opposition regarding the possibility of the contingency planning being leaked to the public.


Passage number 257.
 MR. FISHER.  Again, I remind myself and everybody else that we have to watch this very, very carefully as we share what alternatives are being developed. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  There will be some minutes.  That’s inevitable.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not express any disagreement or contention. It is a statement by Mr. Fisher reminding everyone to be cautious and attentive while sharing alternatives that are being developed.


Passage number 258.
 MR. FISHER.  We need to think about that then because we could scare the heck out of people. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Again, the liquidity issues or the financial stability issues don’t have to take place in this particular context.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply suggesting that they need to consider the potential impact on people if they were to scare them. There is no opposition or argument happening.


Passage number 259.
 MR. FISHER.  And we did it well during the crisis, and there was almost no leakage.  So I just want to remind folks.  I think it’s critical. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not have any contention or disagreement. It simply states an opinion and shares a reminder.
